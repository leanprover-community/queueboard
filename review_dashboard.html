This result already exists as `enumOrd_isNormal_iff_isClosed`, however that version of the statement adds a large amount of imports due to the fact that it refers to the topological notion of closedness. This is intended as a more lightweight/convenient substitute.

I intend to eventually golf down `enumOrd_isNormal_iff_isClosed` using this, but the `Ordinal.Topology` file requires large refactoring anyways (in the form of generalizing results to other linear orders, and getting rid of `bsup`). So I'd rather get that out of the way first.

      <td>Show that the angles of an equilateral simplex in a Euclidean space are `π / 3`, and define the property of a simplex (typically a triangle) being acute-angled.  (This property is more common and more useful than the alternatives of "has a right angle" and "has an obtuse angle", since when it's given that a triangle has one of the latter properties, normally it's stated *which* angle is a right angle or an obtuse angle, in which case you just have an equation or inequality for a given angle.  So while those other properties will be wanted eventually - occasionally a problem does involve such properties without stating which angle is involved - they are lower priority.)

There's a legitimate question of whether we even want `Ordinal.pred` (see [Zulip](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/channel/287929-mathlib4/topic/Ordinal.2Epred)) but this should be a good change in the meanwhile regardless.

In this PR, we introduce the definition of the skewed convolution product on `SkewMonoidAlgebra k G`. Here, the product of two elements `f g : SkewMonoidAlgebra k G` is the finitely supported function whose value at `a` is the sum of `f x * (x • g y)` over all pairs `x, y` such that `x * y = a`.

We also introduce the associated algebraic instances.

## Context
This is the third part of a planned series of PRs aiming to formalise skew monoid algebras.
The PRs are split to ease the review process. The moral sum of these planned PRs is #10541.
The first and second part were #15878 and #19084.

Still want to add support for:

- The monoidal coherence theorem, which I've already ported in my `discretion` library
- The `coherence` tactic, which should work fine for premonoidal categories too
but wanted to get this in front of reviewers ASAP to make sure my general approach was alright

---
I found myself needing this repeatedly when using induced subgraphs. Maybe it would be nice to have in mathlib?

I added `s : Set V` as an explicit parameter, despite it being declared as a variable earlier, because that's how the following section on `DeleteVerts` does it. Maybe I shouldn't.

      <td>This is the first part of #21769, namely defining the new tactic, and only tagging the lemmas that have to be tagged to match the old behaviour.

This includes
- The `push_neg` tactic, which is a macro for `push Not`
- The `push` tactic
- The `↓pushNeg` simproc that can be used as `simp [↓pushNeg]`
- The `push` and `push_neg` tactics in `conv` mode.
- The `#push_discr_tree` command to help see what lemmas the tactic is using for a given constant.

There are two new files: `Mathlib.Tactic.Push` and `Mathlib.Tactic.Push.Attr`. The latter only introduces the `@[push]` attribute, so that it can be used by early Mathlib files without having to import `Mathlib.Tactic.Push`.

      <td>Given an `InnerProductSpace ℝ E`, this file defines two canonical tensors.

* `InnerProductSpace.canonicalContravariantTensor E : E ⊗[ℝ] E →ₗ[ℝ] ℝ`. This is the element corresponding to the inner product.

* If `E` is finite-dimensional, then `E ⊗[ℝ] E` is canonically isomorphic to its dual. Accordingly, there exists an element `InnerProductSpace.canonicalCovariantTensor E : E ⊗[ℝ] E` corresponding to `InnerProductSpace.canonicalContravariantTensor E` under this identification.

This material is used in [Project VD](https://github.com/kebekus/ProjectVD), which aims to formalize Value Distribution Theory for meromorphic functions on the complex plane. The canonical tensors are useful for defining the Laplace operator on inner product spaces in a coordinate-free way.

      <td>We introduce the notion of an `m`-admissible list of natural number: a list `[i₀,…,iₙ]` is said to be `m`-admissible if `iₖ ≤ m + k` for all valid index `k`. These lists are intended to uniquely represents either `P_σ` or `P_δ` morphisms in `SimplexCategoryGenRel`.
We prove basic stability of such lists under some lists operation such as the tail.
We also introduce the notion of simplicial insertion, which is intended to be the algorithm on such normal forms representing composition on the right (for `P_σ` morphisms) or on the left (for `P_δ` morphisms) by a single morphism, and we prove that this preserves admissibility.

Part of a series of PR formalising that `SimplexCategoryGenRel` is equivalent to `SimplexCategory`.

      <td>If `K` is a valued ring taking values in the multiplicative integers wth a zero adjoined, then `Valued.WithZeroMulInt.tendsto_zero_pow_of_le_neg_one` is the result that `x ^ n` tends to zero in this ring if `v x` is at most `-1` valued. As a result, in `adicCompletion K v`, we can always find a non-zero divisor that is arbitrarily small across a finite number of `v` (`AdicCompletion.exists_nonZeroDivisor_finset_valued_lt`).

      <td><a href='https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/22488'>fix: lower priority for `UniformSpace.Completion.instSMul`</a></td>
      <td>Following the introduction of the `WithVal` type synonym in #22055 the following instance takes a long time to synthesise in FLT, and times out in the default heartbeats
```lean
import Mathlib

namespace IsDedekindDomain.HeightOneSpectrum

variable (A K : Type*) [CommRing A] [Field K] [Algebra A K] [IsFractionRing A K] 
  [IsDedekindDomain A] (v : HeightOneSpectrum A)

#synth SMul (v.adicCompletionIntegers K) (v.adicCompletion K)
```

The issue is that `UniformSpace.Completion.instSMul (v.adicCompletionIntegers K) (v.adicCompletion K)` now fires during the start of instance search (because we now have `UniformSpace (WithVal (v.valuation K))` whereas previously this would be `UniformSpace K`, which was not automatic), and this takes a long time to fail (leading to ~1400 entries in the trace). The first few lines of the new trace is
```lean
 [Meta.synthInstance] [5.512418] ✅️ SMul (↥(adicCompletionIntegers K v)) (adicCompletion K v) ▼
    [] [0.000118] new goal SMul (↥(adicCompletionIntegers K v)) (adicCompletion K v) ▶
    [] [0.000537] ✅️ apply UniformSpace.Completion.instSMul to SMul (↥(adicCompletionIntegers K v)) (adicCompletion K v) ▶
    [] [0.004411] ✅️ apply @WithVal.instSMul to SMul (↥(adicCompletionIntegers K v)) (WithVal (valuation K v)) ▶

    [] [0.000378] ✅️ apply @Algebra.toSMul to SMul (↥(adicCompletionIntegers K v)) K ▶
...
    [] 1339 more entries... ▶
```

Lowering the priority of `UniformSpace.Completion.instSMul` fixes this particular issue, leading to a trace that matches that seen prior to the introduction of `WithVal`:
```lean
[Meta.synthInstance] [0.016405] ✅️ SMul (↥(adicCompletionIntegers K v)) (adicCompletion K v) ▼

This is used in order to construct a resolution functor `LeftResolutions.chainComplexFunctor : A ⥤ ChainComplex C ℕ`.

      <td>This is one of a series of PRs that generalizes type classes across Mathlib. These are generated using a new linter that tries to re-elaborate theorem definitions with more general type classes to see if it succeeds. It will accept the generalization if deleting the entire type class causes the theorem to fail to compile. Otherwise, the type class is not being generalized, but can simply be replaced by implicit type class synthesis (or an implicit type class in a variable block being pulled in.)

The linter currently output debug statements indicating source file positions where type classes should be generalized, and a script then makes those edits. This file contains a subset of those generalizations. The linter and the script performing re-writes is available in commit 7b436512017640c3c33aea50b2435b2ee0d995c9.

Note that this PR specifically generalizes theorems across a range of files and type classes, the common theme is that the resulting changes all cause type classes in variable declarations to go unused.

This PR defines in the new file `Mathlib/GroupTheory/FreeGroup/ReducedWords.lean` some extra lemmas for free groups, in particular about (cyclically) reduced words.

## Main declarations

* `FreeGroup.Red.reduced`: the predicate for reduced words
* `FreeGroup.Red.cyclicallyReduced`: the predicate for cyclically reduced words

## Main statements
* `FreeGroup.infinite_order`: nontrivial elements of a free group have infinite order
* `FreeGroup.zpow_left_injective`: taking n-th powers is an injective function on the free group

      <td>This PR defines compactly generated spaces as a topological space where a set is open iff its intersection with every compact set is open in that compact set. There is a [definition of compactly generated spaces already in mathlib](https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/Mathlib/Topology/Compactness/CompactlyGeneratedSpace.html#CompactlyGeneratedSpace) but that definition is stronger than the one presented here. They do however agree on Hausdorff spaces. See [this wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compactly_generated_space) for an explanation for the three different definitions of compactly generated spaces used in literature.

      <td>Define transcendence degree `Algebra.trdeg` and proves some basic properties:

In **AlgebraicIndependent/Basic.lean**: define `Algebra.trdeg` to be the supremum of the cardinalities of all AlgebraicIndependent sets, just like `Module.rank` is defined to be the supremum of the cardinalities of all LinearIndependent sets. Add some API lemmas and trivial results about `trdeg`, e.g. that injective/surjective AlgHoms induce inequalities between `trdeg`s, and AlgEquivs induce equalities.

In **AlgebraicIndependent/TranscendenceBasis.lean**, we show:

+ The AlgebraicIndependent sets in a domain form a Matroid, which is used to show all transcendence bases have the same cardinality. Provide algebraic characterizations of the matroid notions `Indep`, `Base`, `cRank`, `Basis`, `closure`, `Flat`, and `Spanning`.

+ Transcendence bases are exactly algebraic independent families that are spanning (i.e. the whole algebra is algebraic over the algebra generated by the family). On the other hand, a spanning set in a domain contains a transcendence basis.

+ There always exists an transcendence basis between an arbitrary AlgebraicIndependent set and an "almost generating" set in a domain.

+ `trdeg R S + trdeg S A = trdeg R A` in a domain, which depends on `AlgebraicIndependent/IsTranscendenceBasis.sumElim_comp`.

+ A finite AlgebraicIndependent family or spanning family in a domain that has the same cardinality as `trdeg` must be a transcendence basis.

In **AlgebraicIndependent/Transcendental.lean**: add API lemmas and show the inequality `trdeg R S + trdeg S A ≤ trdeg R A` (which does not require a domain).

In **AlgebraicIndependent/Defs.lean**: add Stacks tags and some trivial API lemmas about IsTranscendenceBasis.

Thanks to Chris Hughes and Jz Pan for preliminary works and Peter Nelson for the hint about Finitary and IndepMatroid.

TODO:

+ [The analogue of StrongRankCondition](https://mathoverflow.net/a/484564) in the setting of algebras, which implies `trdeg R (MvPolynomial (Fin n) R) = n` for all Nontrivial CommRing R.

      <td>This PR defines three finiteness notions on (classical) CW complexes: finite dimensionality, finite type, and finiteness. A CW complex is finite dimensional if the indexing type of cells is empty in all but finitely many dimensions. It is of finite type if the indexing type of cells is finite in every dimension. Lastly, a CW complex is finite if it is both finite dimensional and of finite type. 
The PR also provides constructors for CW complexes that are of finite type or finite and proves that a CW complex is finite iff the total number of cells is finite.

      <td>This PR adds lemmas about the exponential growth of a composition `u ∘ v` depending on the exponential growth of `u` and the linear growth of `v`.

Most new stuff is in `Analysis.Asymptotics.ExpGrowth` (mostly sections _Composition_ and _Monotone sequences_). I also slightly modified the four lemmas `expGrowthInf_le_iff`, `le_expGrowthInf_iff`, etc. to use large inequalities instead of strict inequalities (it's more comfortable for me).

In `Data.Real.EReal`: A new lemma (the inversion is antitone on the positives), and a small tweak to three lemmas (`exists_lt_mul_left_of_nonneg`...), making them slightly stronger; their old use is not impacted, and the improvement makes some new proofs slightly nicer.

In `Order.LiminfLimsup`: A few new lemmas about: liminf and limsup of compositions, versions with large inequalities of `limsup_le_iff` and friends, and a way to compare liminf & limsup of two functions. I've also squeezed some life out of `isBoundedUnder_le_mul_of_nonneg` by replacing an eventual condition with a frequent condition; the new version is not _strictly_ more general, but the cases which are not covered anymore don't seem really interesting (empty filter or weird structures), so the trade-off feels favorable.

In `Topology.Algebra.Order.LiminfLimsup`: Again, some eventual conditions are replaced by frequent conditions (about the limsup of a product on the reals).

In `Topology.Instances.EReal.Lemmas`: Again, some eventual conditions are replaced by frequent conditions (about the limsup of a product on the extended reals).

```
import Mathlib

example (X Y : Type) [Fintype X] [Fintype Y] (f : X → Y) (hf : f.Injective) :
    Fintype.card X ≤ Fintype.card Y := by
  hint

example (m n : ℕ) (f : Fin m → Fin n) (hf : f.Injective) :
    m ≤ n := by
  hint

example (X Y : Type) [Fintype X] [Fintype Y] (f : X ↪ Y) :
    Fintype.card X ≤ Fintype.card Y := by
  hint

example (m n : ℕ) (f : Fin m ↪ Fin n) :
    m ≤ n := by
  hint
```
The 1st and 3rd `hint` succeed, but the 2nd a 4th `hint` fail.

The problem is obviously that `exact?` does not see through `Fintype.card (Fin n) = n` when searching for appropriate lemma.
It may seem to not be a problem, as it will rarely derail experienced Mathlib users — after all, experienced Leaners usually go directly for the `Finset` or `Fintype` version.

However, beginners frequently work with `Fin` and they will expect stuff like
```
theorem le_of_injective (f : Fin m → Fin n) (hf : f.Injective) : m ≤ n
```
to exist; therefore, when `hint` or `exact?` fails, it is a very unpleasant surprise.

This PR addressed this issue; not to provide useful content for advanced users, but to make Mathlib more useful for beginners.

We also add instances saying that, if the monoid with zero `M` is `LeftCancelMulZero` (resp. `RightCancelMulZero`), then the submonoid of nonzero divisors is a `LeftCancelMonoid` (resp. `RightCancelMonoid`). This is needed (well, the left version one) so that we can apply the above equivalence to the monoid of nonzero integral ideals of a Dedekind ring.

      <td>### Description
Define a model of **oracle computability**, introducing Turing reducibility (`≤ᵀ`), Turing equivalence (`≡ᵀ`), and Turing degrees as the quotient under Turing equivalence.

- `RecursiveIn O f`: A function `f` is recursive in a set of oracles `O` if it can be computed using `O` via basic operations (zero, successor, pairing, composition, primitive recursion, and μ-recursion).
- `TuringReducible`: The relation that `f` is recursive in `{g}`, i.e., `f ≤ᵀ g`.
- `TuringEquivalent`: A relation defining Turing equivalence between partial functions.
- `TuringDegree`: The set of equivalence classes under `TuringEquivalent`, forming a **partially ordered structure**.

Additionally:
- Prove that `TuringReducible` is a **preorder** (reflexive, transitive).
- Show that `TuringEquivalent` is an **equivalence relation**.
- Establish that **partial recursive functions** correspond to functions recursive in the empty oracle set.

This formalization follows classical recursion theory (Odifreddi, Soare) and extends previous work by Carneiro.

Some questions:

* Does this generalize to multilinear maps?
* Is there an `RCLike` generalization?
* Does this generalize to `BilinMap` instead of just `BilinForm`?

Perhaps the approach in [#mathlib4 > Stating Schrodinger's equation @ 💬](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/channel/287929-mathlib4/topic/Stating.20Schrodinger's.20equation/near/500409890) of using `ContinuousLinearMap.adjoint'` is better.

      <td>This is a refactor of `NumberField.regulator`.

We introduce `regOfFamily` which is the regulator of a family of units indexed by `Fin (Units.rank K)`. It is equal to `0` if the family is not `isMaxRank`. This a `Prop` that says that the image of the family in the `logSpace K` is linearly independent and thus generates a full lattice. All the results about computing the `regulator` by some matrix determinant computation are now proved more generally for `regOfFamily`. 

The `regulator` of a number field is still defined as the covolume of the `unitLattice` and we prove that is is also equal to `regOfFamily` of the system of fundamental units `fundSystem k`. Together with the results about computing `regOfFamily`, we recover that way the results about computing the regulator.

      <td>Given a continuous bilinear map `B : E →L[𝕜] F →L[𝕜] G`, we define an associated map `ContinuousLinearMap.holder : Lp E p μ → Lp F q μ → Lp G r μ` where `p q r` are a Hölder triple. We bundle this into a bilinear map `ContinuousLinearMap.holderₗ` and a continuous bilinear map `ContinuousLinearMap.holderL` under some additional assumptions.

We also declare a heterogeneous scalar multiplication (`HSMul`) instance on `MeasureTheory.Lp` spaces. Although this could use the `ContinuousLinearMap.holder` construction above, we opt not to do so in order to minimize the necessary type class assumptions.

When `p q : ℝ≥0∞` are Hölder conjugate (i.e., `HolderConjugate p q`), we also construct the natural map `ContinuousLinearMap.lpPairing : Lp E p μ →L[𝕜] Lp F q μ →L[𝕜] G` given by `fun f g ↦ ∫ x, B (f x) (g x) ∂μ`.

Note: this makes the second example (the first being matrices) of a true heterogeneous (scalar, in this case) multiplication occurring in practice. Right now, none of our distributivity lemmas can be stated for in that context. Moreover, we can't have `IsScalarTower` or `SMulCommClass` instances for these.

      <td>The `Seq` API in the `Seq.lean` file was somewhat disorganized. This PR reorganizes the file to make it more structured.  

It arranges the API in the following way:
1. Definitions and the `get?` function.  
2. Constructors: `nil` and `cons`.  
3. Destructors: `head`, `tail`, and `destruct`.  
4. Recursion and corecursion principles.  
5. Bisimulation.  
6. `Terminates` API.  
7. `Membership` for sequences.  
8. Conversion to and from other types (`List`, `Stream`, `MLList`) and `take` operation as it is required for conversion to `List`.  
9. Definitions of other operations on sequences (`append`, `map`, `join`, etc.).  
10. Lemmas about conversions and operations, organized into sections by the primary operation of each lemma.

I tried not to change any proofs here, but had to rewrite some of them due to dependencies and to avoid importing `apply_fun`. The proofs of the following lemmas were changed:  
* `head_eq_some`  
* `head_eq_none`  
* `cons_ne_nil`  
* `cons_eq_cons`  
* `ofList`  

I found it useful to run `git diff --color-moved` to verify that the actual difference is just these proofs and adding sections.

      <td>The type `ObjectProperty` was recently introduced #22286 for predicates on the objects of a category. We redefine `FullSubcategory` as `ObjectProperty.FullSubcategory`. This refactor PR mostly does only minimal changes to take into account that some definitions were renamed. The only significant exception is for the definition of the category of finitely generated modules in `Algebra.Category.FGModuleCat.Basic`, which should become the better practice for defining full subcategories, especially when we want to infer certain type classes: define a property of objects (here `ModuleCat.isFG`) and define the category as an abbreviation (here `abbrev FGModuleCat := (ModuleCat.isFG R).FullSubcategory`). Following this approach, significantly many of the typeclasses on the category `FGModuleCat R` can be inferred automatically.

      <td>If `R` is a non-associative ring, then  `(x * y) * z - x * (y * z)` is called the `associator` of
ring elements `x y z : R`. We realize the associator as a map that is an `AddMonoidHom` in each
argument. The associator vanishes exactly when `R` is associative. We prove a similar statement for
semirings by directly comparing the maps `mull₃` and `mulr₃`, the `AddMonoidHom` versions of the
multiplications `(x * y) * z` and `x * (y * z)`.

At the moment, for `A : Matrix m n R`, the term `A.rank` is only well-defined for `Fintype n` and `CommRing R`. This is because the definition is in terms of `MulVecLin`, which requires these typeclass assumptions. The `Fintype` assumption, especially, is a little unfortunate, since it necessitates unnecessary and column/row-asymmetric `Fintype` assumptions throughout the API, and makes it impossible to state the important lemma `rank_transpose` for infinite matrices. 

We don't touch the current definition `Matrix.rank` directly here, but we introduce cardinal and ENat-valued notions of rank for infinite matrices, with basic API for monotonicity. The lemma `cRank_toNat_eq_rank` is a proof of concept - it shows that the current `Matrix.rank` could easily be redefined as `Matrix.rank A := (Matrix.cRank A).toNat` with a strict gain in generality, and no loss to the existing API. The plan is to do this, and thereby prove `rank_transpose` in greater generality, in coming PRs. 

The definition `Matrix.eRank` is  also natural, since `Matrix.eRank_transpose` will be true, but `Matrix.cRank_transpose` will not.

      <td>Given a relation `r` on a type `α`, the shortlex order over `r` on lists (first compare by length; if equal, then compare by lexicographic order over `r`) is defined. We prove that this inherits properties from the underlying relation `r` such as trichotomous-icity, asymmetry, order-connectedness. 

Most importantly, `Shortlex r` is well-founded if `r` is well-founded, giving a well-founded order on lists. (Notably, List.Lex is not well-founded).

      <td>In this PR, we implement a new tactic that reduces expressions in a `LieRing` to a normal form and checks whether they are equal, and a command which reduces the expression and displays the normal form. 

The implementation of this tactic imitates the `ring` tactic, using the `Qq` package to implement a specific reduction algorithm, following the theory of Hall sets and Lyndon words. A reference for the algorithm can be found at, for example, [here](https://personal.math.ubc.ca/~cass/research/pdf/Free.pdf).

This project is the result of a workshop at Peking University, and @siddhartha-gadgil has helped us a lot on understanding the concepts in metaprogramming.

Edit: The changes are reverted to a point where only `AtomM` is used.

* in `Data.PFun`, `aesop` was very slow to prove a goal, restore manual proof
* in `Data.Sign`, I turned a `CoeTC SignType ɑ` instance into `Coe SignType ɑ` (since `CoeTC` is an implementation detail), but this would mean that for any coercion to `ɑ` we'd try `SignType` as an intermediate step. Instead make it a `CoeTail` so it would only be applied as a fallback.

      <td>This is one of a series of PRs that generalizes type classes across Mathlib. These are generated using a new linter that tries to re-elaborate theorem definitions with more general type classes to see if it succeeds. It will accept the generalization if deleting the entire type class causes the theorem to fail to compile. Otherwise, the type class is not being generalized, but can simply be replaced by implicit type class synthesis (or an implicit type class in a variable block being pulled in.)

The linter currently output debug statements indicating source file positions where type classes should be generalized, and a script then makes those edits. This file contains a subset of those generalizations. The linter and the script performing re-writes is available in commit 7b436512017640c3c33aea50b2435b2ee0d995c9.

      <td>In the Toric project, we need to talk about (additive) irreducible elements of a lattice cone (they generate the cone). There is no definition of additive irreducible elements in mathlib, but luckily the existing definition of multiplicative irreducible elements talks about general monoids (instead of merely monoids with zero).

This PR additivises all the API, except for the parts about divisibility and monoids with zero, and moves it to a new file under `Algebra.Group`. Also rename the fields of `Irreducible` to make them additivisable.

Moves:
* `Irreducible.not_unit` -> `Irreducible.not_isUnit`
* `Irreducible.isUnit_or_isUnit'` -> `Irreducible.isUnit_or_isUnit`

      <td>Behind this click-baity title, there is the fact that `Monoid.IsTorsionFree` is incorrect for torsion-free monoids. Indeed, if `n ≠ 0` then `∀ a : α, n • a = 0 → a = 0` is equivalent to `∀ a b : α, n • a = n • b → a = b` only if `α` is a group. If `α` is a monoid (possibly even cancellative!), then the `∀ a : α, n • a = 0 → a = 0` condition is quite weak.

This PR introduces this new definition under the names `IsAddTorsionFree`/`IsMulTorsionFree`. Several things to note:
* It is a class, while `Monoid.IsTorsionFree` is not.
* It is outside of the `Monoid`/`AddMonoid` namespace. My thought is that people who care about torsion-free groups will prefer writing `IsAddTorsionFree G` over `Monoid.IsTorsionFree`.
* I am making a new file. This is because the existing definitions talk about order of an element, which is a much more advanced notion than the new one I am offering.
* I am not changing the existing definition in this PR. This will be done in a later PR.

---

The original lemmas are used in `positivity` or seem to still be useful in places that benefit from only dealing with `0` and not also `-1` as a concept, so they are retained.

      <td>The stronger statement is necessary when we wish that `H` and `H ⊔ N` in the statement `_ ⧸ N.subgroupOf H ≃* _ ⧸ N.subgroupOf (H ⊔ N)` may need to be of a type larger than whichever subgroup `H` is normal in. Furthermore, this commit adapts some basic results about Normal subgroups to be wrt subgroups of normalizers instead.

Moves:
- Subgroup.le_normalizer_of_normal -> Subgroup.le_normalizer_of_normal_subgroupOf

---

The primary reason for introducing this variation is that the existing formulation becomes a pain when quotienting subnormal groups. So suppose my ambient group is `G` and my normalizer is `T : Subgroup G`, the result I can get from the existing formulation is something like `_ ⧸ (N : T).subgroupOf (H : T) ≃* _ ⧸ (N : T).subgroupOf (H ⊔ N : T)`, and it is difficult or tedious to recover the desired statement `_ ⧸ N.subgroupOf H ≃* _ ⧸ N.subgroupOf (H ⊔ N)` from it.

      <td>Currently, the order of an analytic function is called `AnalyticAt.order` and has a single explicit argument `hf : AnalyticAt 𝕜 f z₀`. This means that working with analytic functions results in contexts full of `hf.order` or, worse, `⋯.order`.

This PR makes the `f` and `z₀` arguments explicit, and drops the `hf` one by introducing a junk value of `0` for non-analytic functions. The resulting function is called `eanalyticOrderAt` and I am also adding a `Nat`-valued version `analyticOrderAt` since `(eanalyticOrderAt f z₀).toNat` was appearing in quite a few lemmas.

I opted for the creation of a separate directory about `DiscreteCategory` so that one could still import `DiscreteCategory.Basic` but not necessarily the content of this PR, which imports `CategoryTheory.Sums.Basic` and `CategoryTheory.Products.Basic`.

      <td>For `A : Matrix m n R` and `i : m`, `j : n`, we define `A.row i` to refer to the `i`th row of `A` as a vector in `n -> R`, and `A.col j` to refer to the `j`th column of `A` as a vector in `m -> R`. `A.row` and `A.col` are defeq to `A` and `A.transpose` respectively, but are helpful to refer to these objects explicitly, avoiding noisy eta-expansions and the simplifier manipulating transposes,  such as in expressions like `Injective A.col`. 

The current version has `Matrix.row` and `Matrix.col` as `def`s rather than `abbrev`s - this allows the simplifier to make the reasonable changes `A.row i j` -> `A i j` and `A.col i j` -> `A j i`, but requires some fixes to a few `rw`s in proofs that exploit the defeq between a matrix and a function. A less aggressive version could have both as `abbrev`s. 

This requires renaming the current `Matrix.row` and `Matrix.col`, which build matrices with constant rows and columns; arguably these names weren't ideal. They have been changed to `Matrix.rowConst` and `Matrix.colConst`, and their API lemmas are renamed in accordance.  

Because we are using the old name, we can't deprecate these terms directly, but we add deprecations for some lemmas about `Matrix.row`/`.col` outside the basic `RowCol` file. We also add notes in both the new and old definitions alerting the user to the change. In particular, a downstream user puzzled that `.row` suddenly fails to typecheck after updating will be pointed to `.rowConst` by looking at the docstring of the changed `.row`.

We also change some spellings to use the new notation (eg `Set.range (fun i => A.transpose i)` -> `Set.range A.col`).

      <td>We refactor the `StrictSegal` infrastructure, making two notable changes:
- The `StrictSegal` class is redefined as a structure, and the class `IsStrictSegal X : Prop` is added in its place.
- `Path`, `StrictSegal`, and related constructions are defined for truncated simplicial sets. A path in a simplicial set `X` is then defined as a 1-truncated path in the 1-truncation of `X`.

- `⦋m⦌ₙ`, which denotes the `m`-dimensional simplex in the `n`-truncated simplex category.
- `X _⦋m⦌ₙ`, which denotes the `m`-th term of an `n`-truncated simplicial object `X`.
- `X ^⦋m⦌ₙ`, which denotes the `m`-th term of an `n`-truncated cosimplicial object `X`.

If `pp.proofs` is set to `true`, we also pretty-print the proof `p : m ≤ n` for all three notations as `⦋m, p⦌ₙ`, `X _⦋m, p⦌ₙ`, and `X ^⦋m, p⦌ₙ`, respectively.

I verified that no declaration disappeared by writing a simple (and ~very show~) script that prints all names in the environment, then running `diff` on two outputs.

UPD: the script was slow because of `#eval`. Turning it into a proper executable made it run in 4s.

      <td>We refactor the category instance on sums of types so that it is defined even for types living in a different universes.

Consequently, we change the order of things related to sums of categories:
  - We remove `simp` instance on `Sum.inl_.map` and `Sum.inr_.map`: the inclusions for maps should be considered primitives.
  - We make `Sum.sum'` the first definition about functors out of a sum.
  - We add an extensionality (up to isomorphism) theorem for functors out of sums in terms of their precomposition with `inl_`and `inr_`.
  - We redefine `Sum.swap`, `Sum.associator` (as well as its inverse), `Functor.sum` to use only `Sum.sum'`.

This refactor follows discussions in #22278 and #22281 and is rather opinionated: the universal property of sums of categories should be the only way one should work with sums and should be the only way one defines functors out of sums.

The proof of the associativity equivalence of categories becomes a bit longer, but I believe it is the morally right one.

This was an occasion to clean up erw's as well.

In this PR, we introduce the definition of the skewed convolution product on `SkewMonoidAlgebra k G`. Here, the product of two elements `f g : SkewMonoidAlgebra k G` is the finitely supported function whose value at `a` is the sum of `f x * (x • g y)` over all pairs `x, y` such that `x * y = a`.

We also introduce the associated algebraic instances.

## Context
This is the third part of a planned series of PRs aiming to formalise skew monoid algebras.
The PRs are split to ease the review process. The moral sum of these planned PRs is #10541.
The first and second part were #15878 and #19084.

Still want to add support for:
- Premonoidal braided/symmetric categories
- The monoidal coherence theorem, which I've already ported in my `discretion` library
- The `coherence` tactic, which should work fine for premonoidal categories too
but wanted to get this in front of reviewers ASAP to make sure my general approach was alright

---
I found myself needing this repeatedly when using induced subgraphs. Maybe it would be nice to have in mathlib?

I added `s : Set V` as an explicit parameter, despite it being declared as a variable earlier, because that's how the following section on `DeleteVerts` does it. Maybe I shouldn't.

      <td>This is one of a series of PRs that generalizes type classes across Mathlib. These are generated using a new linter that tries to re-elaborate theorem definitions with more general type classes to see if it succeeds. It will accept the generalization if deleting the entire type class causes the theorem to fail to compile. Otherwise, the type class is not being generalized, but can simply be replaced by implicit type class synthesis (or an implicit type class in a variable block being pulled in.)

The linter currently output debug statements indicating source file positions where type classes should be generalized, and a script then makes those edits. This file contains a subset of those generalizations. The linter and the script performing re-writes is available in commit 7b436512017640c3c33aea50b2435b2ee0d995c9.

Note that this PR specifically generalizes theorems across a range of files and type classes, the common theme is that the resulting changes all cause type classes in variable declarations to go unused.

This PR defines in the new file `Mathlib/GroupTheory/FreeGroup/ReducedWords.lean` some extra lemmas for free groups, in particular about (cyclically) reduced words.

## Main declarations

* `FreeGroup.Red.reduced`: the predicate for reduced words
* `FreeGroup.Red.cyclicallyReduced`: the predicate for cyclically reduced words

## Main statements
* `FreeGroup.infinite_order`: nontrivial elements of a free group have infinite order
* `FreeGroup.zpow_left_injective`: taking n-th powers is an injective function on the free group

      <td>### Description
Define a model of **oracle computability**, introducing Turing reducibility (`≤ᵀ`), Turing equivalence (`≡ᵀ`), and Turing degrees as the quotient under Turing equivalence.

- `RecursiveIn O f`: A function `f` is recursive in a set of oracles `O` if it can be computed using `O` via basic operations (zero, successor, pairing, composition, primitive recursion, and μ-recursion).
- `TuringReducible`: The relation that `f` is recursive in `{g}`, i.e., `f ≤ᵀ g`.
- `TuringEquivalent`: A relation defining Turing equivalence between partial functions.
- `TuringDegree`: The set of equivalence classes under `TuringEquivalent`, forming a **partially ordered structure**.

Additionally:
- Prove that `TuringReducible` is a **preorder** (reflexive, transitive).
- Show that `TuringEquivalent` is an **equivalence relation**.
- Establish that **partial recursive functions** correspond to functions recursive in the empty oracle set.

This formalization follows classical recursion theory (Odifreddi, Soare) and extends previous work by Carneiro.

      <td>If `R` is a non-associative ring, then  `(x * y) * z - x * (y * z)` is called the `associator` of
ring elements `x y z : R`. We realize the associator as a map that is an `AddMonoidHom` in each
argument. The associator vanishes exactly when `R` is associative. We prove a similar statement for
semirings by directly comparing the maps `mull₃` and `mulr₃`, the `AddMonoidHom` versions of the
multiplications `(x * y) * z` and `x * (y * z)`.

      <td>In this PR, we implement a new tactic that reduces expressions in a `LieRing` to a normal form and checks whether they are equal, and a command which reduces the expression and displays the normal form. 

The implementation of this tactic imitates the `ring` tactic, using the `Qq` package to implement a specific reduction algorithm, following the theory of Hall sets and Lyndon words. A reference for the algorithm can be found at, for example, [here](https://personal.math.ubc.ca/~cass/research/pdf/Free.pdf).

This project is the result of a workshop at Peking University, and @siddhartha-gadgil has helped us a lot on understanding the concepts in metaprogramming.

Edit: The changes are reverted to a point where only `AtomM` is used.

      <td>This is one of a series of PRs that generalizes type classes across Mathlib. These are generated using a new linter that tries to re-elaborate theorem definitions with more general type classes to see if it succeeds. It will accept the generalization if deleting the entire type class causes the theorem to fail to compile. Otherwise, the type class is not being generalized, but can simply be replaced by implicit type class synthesis (or an implicit type class in a variable block being pulled in.)

The linter currently output debug statements indicating source file positions where type classes should be generalized, and a script then makes those edits. This file contains a subset of those generalizations. The linter and the script performing re-writes is available in commit 7b436512017640c3c33aea50b2435b2ee0d995c9.

      <td>The stronger statement is necessary when we wish that `H` and `H ⊔ N` in the statement `_ ⧸ N.subgroupOf H ≃* _ ⧸ N.subgroupOf (H ⊔ N)` may need to be of a type larger than whichever subgroup `H` is normal in. Furthermore, this commit adapts some basic results about Normal subgroups to be wrt subgroups of normalizers instead.

Moves:
- Subgroup.le_normalizer_of_normal -> Subgroup.le_normalizer_of_normal_subgroupOf

---

The primary reason for introducing this variation is that the existing formulation becomes a pain when quotienting subnormal groups. So suppose my ambient group is `G` and my normalizer is `T : Subgroup G`, the result I can get from the existing formulation is something like `_ ⧸ (N : T).subgroupOf (H : T) ≃* _ ⧸ (N : T).subgroupOf (H ⊔ N : T)`, and it is difficult or tedious to recover the desired statement `_ ⧸ N.subgroupOf H ≃* _ ⧸ N.subgroupOf (H ⊔ N)` from it.

The files deprimed in this PR are
* Files at the top of the output of [this run](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/actions/runs/13648146304/job/38150779111), up to and including `Data.Multiset.Basic`
* Files that directly import `Mathlib.Tactic.Cases` and a downstream file to build
* `Data.Nat.Bitwise`, for using `induction'` in a local tactic

Note that there are a variety of indentation styles for `induction'`; I have tried to keep the count of changed lines small without sacrificing prettiness.</td>
