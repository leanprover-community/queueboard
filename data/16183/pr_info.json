I would like to know @urkud's opinion as I am aware he needs translation for dynamical systems. Here are a few points of concern I am aware of:\n* There is no multiplicative version. That's because I do not need the multiplicative version and wouldn't know how to call it\n* This is basically an action by `DomMulAct`. The trouble is that it would be inconvenient to state it this way because I would also need to stick some `op` in there. And generally this action is wide-spread in LeanAPAP and I want custom notation for it.\n\n[![Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io/from-referrer/)\n",

Follows mathematical convention, can be multiplicativised (eg `τₘ a f` as notation for `DomMulAct.mk a⁻¹ • f`) and also works for other actions (eg of a subgroup, on the right by using `τ (op a) f`). The not great thing is that simp would turn `τ (-a) f` into `DomAddAct.mk a +ᵥ f`.\r\n2. Define `τ a f` as notation for `DomAddAct.mk a +ᵥ f`. Can be multiplicativised, also works for other actions (same as above), doesn't have an issue with simp removing the notation. The not so great thing is that it doesn't follow mathematical convention, but only to the extent that the action by `DomMulAct` doesn't*.\r\n3. Define `τ a f` as a `def` which is equal to `DomAddAct.mk (-a) +ᵥ f`. Follows mathematical convention, but doesn't work for other actions and is not multiplicativised.\r\n4. Define four kinds of `τ`-like notations as `def`s. Follows mathematical convention, but doesn't work for other actions.\r\n\r\n*One could redefine the action by `DomMulAct` so that `(DomMulAct.mk c • f) a = f (c⁻¹ • a)`, instead of `(DomMulAct.mk c • f) a = f (c • a)` currently. What do you think, @urkud ?\r\n\r\nSolution 1 won't be viable. Solution 3 is the one I currently have. Solution 4 is what you are pushing for, Johan. Solution 2 is what I see as the mathlib philosophy one, and it can be made to follow mathematical convention if we redefine the `DomMulAct` action.",

Follows mathematical convention, can be multiplicativised (eg `τₘ a f` as notation for `DomMulAct.mk a⁻¹ • f`) and also works for other actions (eg of a subgroup, on the right by using `τ (op a) f`). The not great thing is that simp would turn `τ (-a) f` into `DomAddAct.mk a +ᵥ f`.\r\n2. Define `τ a f` as notation for `DomAddAct.mk a +ᵥ f`. Can be multiplicativised, also works for other actions (same as above), doesn't have an issue with simp removing the notation. The not so great thing is that it doesn't follow mathematical convention, but only to the extent that the action by `DomMulAct` doesn't*.\r\n3. Define `τ a f` as a `def` which is equal to `DomAddAct.mk (-a) +ᵥ f`. Follows mathematical convention, but doesn't work for other actions and is not multiplicativised.\r\n4. Define four kinds of `τ`-like notations as `def`s. Follows mathematical convention, but doesn't work for other actions.\r\n\r\n*One could redefine the action by `DomMulAct` so that `(DomMulAct.mk c • f) a = f (c⁻¹ • a)`, instead of `(DomMulAct.mk c • f) a = f (c • a)` currently. What do you think, @urkud ?\r\n\r\nSolution 1 won't be viable. Solution 3 is the one I currently have. Solution 4 is what you are pushing for, Johan. Solution 2 is what I see as the mathlib philosophy one, and it can be made to follow mathematical convention if we redefine the `DomMulAct` action.",
