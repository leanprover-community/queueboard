I was just thinking about that right now.

I was just thinking about that right now. I assumed (by motivation of why relabelling would exist) that relabelling was a stronger relation than identical, but presumably from the (motive for) deprecation, it's the same as identical?",

This PR's motivation was to use a stronger relation for the theory of dominated games that I was writing. However, it makes sense that the notion of relabelling is quite useless in combinatorial game theory.\r\n\r\nFeel free to close this if it gets in the way of that goal. :+1: ",
