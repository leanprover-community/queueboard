I'm going to ask you to start a discussion topic on Zulip (in the \"mathlib4\" or \"PR reviews\" channel) about your reasons for wanting a definition of gradient in this form -- is it really too awkward to work with the Frechet derivative in your intended use case?  If we add this definition to mathlib, we will need to duplicate a lot of the theory of the Frechet derivative (as you have already done in this PR), so it's a lot of overhead and we should be sure that it's worth while.\r\n\r\nHere, I will make a first review of the PR assuming that after the discussion everyone agrees that having this definition is worth while.",

I'm going to ask you to start a discussion topic on Zulip (in the \"mathlib4\" or \"PR reviews\" channel) about your reasons for wanting a definition of gradient in this form -- is it really too awkward to work with the Frechet derivative in your intended use case?  If we add this definition to mathlib, we will need to duplicate a lot of the theory of the Frechet derivative (as you have already done in this PR), so it's a lot of overhead and we should be sure that it's worth while.\r\n\r\nHere, I will make a first review of the PR assuming that after the discussion everyone agrees that having this definition is worth while.",
