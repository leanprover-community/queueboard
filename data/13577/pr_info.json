I guess one argument for the approach in this PR is that `w.completion` inherits all the `UniformSpace.Completion` API. E.g., any uniform continuous function on `K` can then be extended to a uniform continuous function on `w.completion`, which I could imagine might be useful further down the line for functions on adele rings. But perhaps that can also be achieved with the `mixedEmbedding` approach. Anyway I agree that, if we do proceed with this PR, at some point we should show that `w.completion` is isomorphic to `ℝ` or `ℂ`, and therefore that the infinite adele ring is isomorphic to `ℝ ^ r₁ × ℂ ^ r₂`.",

I guess one argument for the approach in this PR is that `w.completion` inherits all the `UniformSpace.Completion` API. E.g., any uniform continuous function on `K` can then be extended to a uniform continuous function on `w.completion`, which I could imagine might be useful further down the line for functions on adele rings. But perhaps that can also be achieved with the `mixedEmbedding` approach. Anyway I agree that, if we do proceed with this PR, at some point we should show that `w.completion` is isomorphic to `ℝ` or `ℂ`, and therefore that the infinite adele ring is isomorphic to `ℝ ^ r₁ × ℂ ^ r₂`.",

On the other hand, I would stronly encourage @smmercuri to add in the `Completion` file things borrowed from @mariainesdff work on norms in non-archimedean fields, so that all results concerning norms, be there archimedean or not, are gathered.",

One should prove that the map from the infinite adeles to the mixed space is measure preserving to use the fact that volume computations are easier in the mixed space. ",
