At the moment, you have basically *no* API for the new definition. I think that probably errs on the side of \"too little\". Is there a modest amount of API you can sensibly add? If not, can you provide some pointers to where this is used? If I am to review this PR, looking through several thousand lines of code is not so nice.",

The complete sublattice structure is not as important, but worth recording. Thus, a design - that probably has none of the issues mentioned above - would be to make `Tree A` an inductive type and add `SetLike` and `CompleteLattice` for this type. The current approach achieves the same results for the type of trees (with almost identical code), but also adds some API for analogous types (admittedly, only for complete sublattices and not other subtypes of `Set _`). This additional API should not be a disadvantage in any situation - at least as long as no global instances are registered.",

Here Sven does it for any sublattice of sets, which potentially could be reused elsewhere, so I don't think that is bad.\r\n* It is indeed a bit arbitrary to only do this for `CompleteSublattice`s of `Set X`, but there is no technical way to do this for any subtype of `Set X` that is as easy to use, right?\r\n* The code Sven linked above shows that it is ok to work with this definition.\r\n\r\nAre there any other objections raised here?

The complete sublattice structure is not as important, but worth recording. Thus, a design - that probably has none of the issues mentioned above - would be to make `Tree A` an inductive type and add `SetLike` and `CompleteLattice` for this type. The current approach achieves the same results for the type of trees (with almost identical code), but also adds some API for analogous types (admittedly, only for complete sublattices and not other subtypes of `Set _`). This additional API should not be a disadvantage in any situation - at least as long as no global instances are registered.",

Here Sven does it for any sublattice of sets, which potentially could be reused elsewhere, so I don't think that is bad.\r\n* It is indeed a bit arbitrary to only do this for `CompleteSublattice`s of `Set X`, but there is no technical way to do this for any subtype of `Set X` that is as easy to use, right?\r\n* The code Sven linked above shows that it is ok to work with this definition.\r\n\r\nAre there any other objections raised here?
