It's `IsClosed {x : Iio o | x.1 ∈ A}`. We shouldn't write this kind of thing all the time so that's why I think it warrants a definition.

Creating the alias automatically turned some arguments from implicit to explicit, arguments like `S` that are part of the definition of `IsClosedBelow`. So then `(h C CmemS).forall_lt p` didn't typecheck because `(h C CmemS).forall_lt` expected the now explicit arguments `S` and `o`. But apparantly surrounding an expressing like that with parentheses forces lean to fill in these inputs, so `((h C CmemS).forall_lt) = (h C CmemS).forall_lt C o`.\r\n\r\nAlso I'm now seeing that this problem just went away hahaha.

It's `IsClosed {x : Iio o | x.1 ∈ A}`. We shouldn't write this kind of thing all the time so that's why I think it warrants a definition. I already have the topological equivalences for both somewhere and I'll PR them when this gets merged, but I'll add a TODO anyways in the meantime.",

Or if that's hard, we can merge it as-is.\r\n\r\nIt is a special case. `IsClosedBelow` is equivalent to `IsClosed (Iio o ↓∩ S)`, `((S ∩ Iio o) ∪ {o})` is just adding all the possible acc points of `S ∩ Iio o` to it (only 1) so that asking if it's closed is the same as asking if it's closed inside `Iio o`.\r\n\r\nI'm currently changing the definition to `IsClosed (Iio o ↓∩ S)` and adding a theorem characterizing it with the current def, I think that's what people want? tbh I still think it's silly not using the original definitions and having the topological ones as theorems (to me it's like defining limit ordinals as accumulation points of `Ord`, which is obviously not done), but this was argued over a lot so now I'm just going along with whatever gets this merged.",

              "body": "I understand your point that it might be a bit silly to give a characterization w.r.t. the topology instead of a direct order-theoretic one, but I think it's important for Mathlib to unify definitions (either use the same definition in many places, or at least show the relations between them). This reminds me of the case of suprema on ordinals: before they were their own definitions, and now (I believe) they have been unified with the standard notion of suprema on conditionally complete lattices, which is nicer.",
