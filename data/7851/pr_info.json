Is this condition weaker?",

I'm a little confused.\r\n\r\nFor the 3rd point, I think there are no relations between IsClosedMap and closed function. For example, the Dirichlet function is a closed map but its epigraph is not closed. Also, considering a lower-semicontinuous but not continuous function(which is also a closed function), the image of a small close interval containing the discontinuous point is not closed.\r\n",

                    "body": "Sure. Indeed it seems the relevant characterization of closed sets is mysteriously absent from Mathlib, although the very closely related `isClosed_iff_clusterPt` is there. You can put\r\n```lean\r\nlemma isClosed_iff_forall_filter {X : Type*} [TopologicalSpace X] {s : Set X} :\r\n    IsClosed s ↔ ∀ x, ∀ F : Filter X, F.NeBot → F ≤ 𝓟 s → F ≤ 𝓝 x → x ∈ s := by\r\n  rw [isClosed_iff_clusterPt]\r\n  exact ⟨fun hs x F F_ne FS Fx ↦ hs _ <| NeBot.mono F_ne (le_inf Fx FS),\r\n         fun hs x hx ↦ hs x (𝓝 x ⊓ 𝓟 s) hx inf_le_right inf_le_left⟩\r\n```\r\nsomewhere close (he he) to `isClosed_iff_clusterPt`. The `F ≤ 𝓟 s → F ≤ 𝓝 x` looks a bit silly, but somehow it felt easier to read than the equivalent `F ≤ 𝓟 s ⊓ 𝓝 x` which would make the proof slightly shorter. The silly version also saves some unpacking or repacking when using the lemma.\r\n\r\nWith this lemma at hand, the theorem under discussion becomes\r\n```lean\r\ntheorem lowerSemicontinuous_iff_IsClosed_epigraph {f : α → γ} :\r\n    LowerSemicontinuous f ↔ IsClosed {p : α × γ | f p.1 ≤ p.2} := by\r\n  constructor\r\n  · rw [lowerSemicontinuous_iff_le_liminf, isClosed_iff_forall_filter]\r\n    rintro hf ⟨x, y⟩ F F_ne h h'\r\n    rw [nhds_prod_eq, le_prod] at h'\r\n    calc f x ≤ liminf f (𝓝 x) := hf x\r\n    _ ≤ liminf f (map Prod.fst F) := liminf_le_liminf_of_le h'.1\r\n    _ ≤ liminf Prod.snd F := liminf_le_liminf <| (eventually_principal.2 fun x ↦ id).filter_mono h\r\n    _ = y := h'.2.liminf_eq    \r\n  · rw [lowerSemicontinuous_iff_isClosed_preimage]\r\n    exact fun hf y ↦ hf.preimage (Continuous.Prod.mk_left y)\r\n```\r\nOf course one shouldn't forget to remove the useless assumption on the topology of `γ`.\r\n\r\nFinal note: before realizing they were true by definition, I thought I would need\r\n```lean\r\nlemma Filter.liminf_comp {α β γ : Type*} [ConditionallyCompleteLattice α] (u : β → α) (v : γ → β)\r\n    (f : Filter γ) : liminf (u ∘ v) f = liminf u (map v f) := rfl\r\n\r\nlemma Filter.limsup_comp {α β γ : Type*} [ConditionallyCompleteLattice α] (u : β → α) (v : γ → β)\r\n    (f : Filter γ) : limsup (u ∘ v) f = limsup u (map v f) := rfl\r\n```\r\nI think those lemmas should be somewhere near the definition of limsup and liminf since otherwise people may look for them just as I did.",

I'm a little confused.\r\n\r\nFor the 3rd point, I think there are no relations between IsClosedMap and closed function. For example, the Dirichlet function is a closed map but its epigraph is not closed. Also, considering a lower-semicontinuous but not continuous function(which is also a closed function), the image of a small close interval containing the discontinuous point is not closed.\r\n",
