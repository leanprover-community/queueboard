Kevin pointed out that this statement might very well be false if the value for `ζ 1` was not well chosen, and took me to task on his public twitter feed for my sloppiness. \r\n\r\nSo the main motivation of this PR is to clear up this mess by demonstrating that the value we assigned for `ζ 1` was nonzero all along.\r\n\r\nMore generally, there is a convention that \"junk\" values should be explicit; e.g. we have a lemma `div_zero` saying that `x / 0 = 0`, we don't just assign a random value but never disclose what it is. (For this reason I seem to recall one of the reviewers when I first added the zeta function – not sure who, maybe Sebastien? – writing that it would be good if we had a lemma explaining precisely what `ζ 1` is.)",

Kevin pointed out that this statement might very well be false if the value for `ζ 1` was not well chosen, and took me to task on his public twitter feed for my sloppiness. \r\n\r\nSo the main motivation of this PR is to clear up this mess by demonstrating that the value we assigned for `ζ 1` was nonzero all along.\r\n\r\nMore generally, there is a convention that \"junk\" values should be explicit; e.g. we have a lemma `div_zero` saying that `x / 0 = 0`, we don't just assign a random value but never disclose what it is. (For this reason I seem to recall one of the reviewers when I first added the zeta function – not sure who, maybe Sebastien? – writing that it would be good if we had a lemma explaining precisely what `ζ 1` is.)",
