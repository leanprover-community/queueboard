Using `prune` mitigates this situation.\r\n\r\nThe tactic also admits an optional natural number argument: `prune n` removes all variables that have not appeared at the `(n+1)`-st stage in the above list.  Thus, `prune 0` only leaves the variables needed for the statement to type-check.  Also, for sufficiently large `n`, `prune n` is a synonym for `prune`.\r\n\r\n[Zulip discussion](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/270676-lean4/topic/substitute.20for.20.60include.2Fomit.60.3F)\r\n\r\n---\r\n<!-- The text above the `---` will become the commit message when your\r\nPR is merged.

I'm imagining `prune` would have similar features as `extract_goal`, but instead of pretty printing a goal state it would have the effect of cleaning up the goal state. The `prune` tactic might want to expose the \"indirect props\" configuration option too, which if I understand correctly, is roughly related to what the \"prune offset\" is controlling, but it's either on or off and only affects Props.",

Maybe there's a better syntax. The mnemonic I was thinking is that `prune!` prunes more.\r\n\r\n(If there's some additional feature we really want to support in `Lean.MVarId.cleanup`, depending on how reasonable it is we *might* be able to get a core change.)\r\n\r\nI think though we should start small with `prune`. If it's just a frontend to `Lean.MVarId.cleanup` I think it's a super easy decision to add the tactic.

I'm imagining `prune` would have similar features as `extract_goal`, but instead of pretty printing a goal state it would have the effect of cleaning up the goal state. The `prune` tactic might want to expose the \"indirect props\" configuration option too, which if I understand correctly, is roughly related to what the \"prune offset\" is controlling, but it's either on or off and only affects Props.",

Maybe there's a better syntax. The mnemonic I was thinking is that `prune!` prunes more.\r\n\r\n(If there's some additional feature we really want to support in `Lean.MVarId.cleanup`, depending on how reasonable it is we *might* be able to get a core change.)\r\n\r\nI think though we should start small with `prune`. If it's just a frontend to `Lean.MVarId.cleanup` I think it's a super easy decision to add the tactic. You might decide to call it `cleanup`, but I think `prune` is evocative and am happy with it myself.",
