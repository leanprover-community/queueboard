(Or would that require importing path-connectedness for connectedness; perhaps that is not desirable.)\r\n\r\nTopology.Connected.PathConnected already imports Topology.Connected.LocallyConnected transitively through [Topology.CompactOpen](https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/Mathlib/Topology/CompactOpen.html), [Topology.ContinuousFunction.Basic](https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/Mathlib/Topology/ContinuousFunction/Basic.html) and [Topology.Homeomorph](https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/Mathlib/Topology/Homeomorph.html), so I think adding an import in the other direction wouldn't work. It would probably be good to untangle some of those imports, for example by moving [Homeomorph.locallyConnectedSpace](https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/Mathlib/Topology/Homeomorph.html#Homeomorph.locallyConnectedSpace) to Topology.Connected.LocallyConnected. But either way, I don't see how results about path-connected spaces could help with general connected spaces - is there anything specific you had in mind?\r\n\r\nThe one place where I do see golfing potential is the other lemmas on locally path-connected spaces, that were already in this file - I didn't touch them because I wanted to keep the PR small, but could also try golfing them a bit if you want.",

(Or would that require importing path-connectedness for connectedness; perhaps that is not desirable.)\r\n\r\nTopology.Connected.PathConnected already imports Topology.Connected.LocallyConnected transitively through [Topology.CompactOpen](https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/Mathlib/Topology/CompactOpen.html), [Topology.ContinuousFunction.Basic](https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/Mathlib/Topology/ContinuousFunction/Basic.html) and [Topology.Homeomorph](https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/Mathlib/Topology/Homeomorph.html), so I think adding an import in the other direction wouldn't work. It would probably be good to untangle some of those imports, for example by moving [Homeomorph.locallyConnectedSpace](https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/Mathlib/Topology/Homeomorph.html#Homeomorph.locallyConnectedSpace) to Topology.Connected.LocallyConnected. But either way, I don't see how results about path-connected spaces could help with general connected spaces - is there anything specific you had in mind?\r\n\r\nThe one place where I do see golfing potential is the other lemmas on locally path-connected spaces, that were already in this file - I didn't touch them because I wanted to keep the PR small, but could also try golfing them a bit if you want.",
