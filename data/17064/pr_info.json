(Or would that require importing path-connectedness for connectedness; perhaps that is not desirable.)\r\n\r\nTopology.Connected.PathConnected already imports Topology.Connected.LocallyConnected transitively through [Topology.CompactOpen](https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/Mathlib/Topology/CompactOpen.html), [Topology.ContinuousFunction.Basic](https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/Mathlib/Topology/ContinuousFunction/Basic.html) and [Topology.Homeomorph](https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/Mathlib/Topology/Homeomorph.html), so I think adding an import in the other direction wouldn't work. It would probably be good to untangle some of those imports, for example by moving [Homeomorph.locallyConnectedSpace](https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/Mathlib/Topology/Homeomorph.html#Homeomorph.locallyConnectedSpace) to Topology.Connected.LocallyConnected. But either way, I don't see how results about path-connected spaces could help with general connected spaces - is there anything specific you had in mind?\r\n\r\nThe one place where I do see golfing potential is the other lemmas on locally path-connected spaces, that were already in this file - I didn't touch them because I wanted to keep the PR small, but could also try golfing them a bit if you want.",

(Or would that require importing path-connectedness for connectedness; perhaps that is not desirable.)\r\n\r\nThis goes beyond your PR: can one use this to prove that manifolds are locally path-connected (and more generally, charted spaces are if modelled on a locally path-connected space), see #7825? If you'd like to prove that, I'll be happy to review that PR :-)",

My understanding is that while `Quot` and `Quotient` are mathematically the same thing, both come up in lean in slightly different contexts, and if you just register the instance for one type it won't be able to infer it for the other. I'm actually using neither instance though, the main theorem I need in further PRs is `LocPathConnectedSpace.coinduced`.",

(Or would that require importing path-connectedness for connectedness; perhaps that is not desirable.)\r\n\r\nTopology.Connected.PathConnected already imports Topology.Connected.LocallyConnected transitively through [Topology.CompactOpen](https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/Mathlib/Topology/CompactOpen.html), [Topology.ContinuousFunction.Basic](https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/Mathlib/Topology/ContinuousFunction/Basic.html) and [Topology.Homeomorph](https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/Mathlib/Topology/Homeomorph.html), so I think adding an import in the other direction wouldn't work. It would probably be good to untangle some of those imports, for example by moving [Homeomorph.locallyConnectedSpace](https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/Mathlib/Topology/Homeomorph.html#Homeomorph.locallyConnectedSpace) to Topology.Connected.LocallyConnected. But either way, I don't see how results about path-connected spaces could help with general connected spaces - is there anything specific you had in mind?\r\n\r\nThe one place where I do see golfing potential is the other lemmas on locally path-connected spaces, that were already in this file - I didn't touch them because I wanted to keep the PR small, but could also try golfing them a bit if you want.",
