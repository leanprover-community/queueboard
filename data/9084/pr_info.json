I'll have a look after I am done with the merge.\r\n\r\n> The fact that (fractional) ideals are free should follow immediately once we know that they're finite (we know that being torsion free and finite implies free). And finiteness should be very easy, these rings are noetherian. Am I missing something?\r\n\r\nNo, you're right. I was not clear: it is indeed direct to see that ideals of a number field satisfy the instances that I need, what I am not sure about is if I should just add the instances for number fields or for a wider situation (and in this case, what situation?). I will probably need to add at some point an `Ideal` file in the number field folder for some results specific to (fractional) ideals of number fields. If you think that having the instances only in the specific case of (fractional) ideals of number fields is good enough, then it will be easy. Otherwise, I think some discussion will be necessary. \r\n\r\nI am sorry if this is a bit vague, hopefully, it will become a bit clearer once I find the time to write things done more properly. \r\n",

I'll have a look after I am done with the merge.\r\n\r\n> The fact that (fractional) ideals are free should follow immediately once we know that they're finite (we know that being torsion free and finite implies free). And finiteness should be very easy, these rings are noetherian. Am I missing something?\r\n\r\nNo, you're right. I was not clear: it is indeed direct to see that ideals of a number field satisfy the instances that I need, what I am not sure about is if I should just add the instances for number fields or for a wider situation (and in this case, what situation?). I will probably need to add at some point an `Ideal` file in the number field folder for some results specific to (fractional) ideals of number fields. If you think that having the instances only in the specific case of (fractional) ideals of number fields is good enough, then it will be easy. Otherwise, I think some discussion will be necessary. \r\n\r\nI am sorry if this is a bit vague, hopefully, it will become a bit clearer once I find the time to write things done more properly. \r\n",
