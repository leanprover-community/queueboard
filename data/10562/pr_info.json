        "body": "`bound` proves inequalities that follow \"obviously by structure\", assuming nonnegativity or positivity of subterms where necessary.  It is built on top of Aesop.  It has significant overlap with `positivity` and `gcongr`, but can also switch back and forth between those modes (such as when proving `0 < a * b - a * c` from `0 < a`, `c < b`).\r\n\r\nZulip discussion: https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/239415-metaprogramming-.2F-tactics/topic/.60bound.60.20mixes.20.60gcongr.60.20and.20.60positivity.60/near/412120380\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nHere's an initial implementation of the `bound` tactic discussed on Zulip, upstreamed from https://github.com/girving/ray/blob/main/Ray/Tactic/Bound.lean.  Happy to do whatever cleanup or further testing is deemed useful.  Some notes:\r\n\r\n1. `mul_inv_le_one_of_nonneg_of_le` and `Real.pi_nonneg` should probably be moved to their appropriate places, but I wanted to check first.\r\n2. `le_self_pow_of_pos` is a wart due to `bound` not knowing what to do with `n ≠ 0` goals.  One option would be give `bound` a rule for `Nat.pos_iff_ne_zero`, so that `n ≠ 0` automatically turns into `0 < n`.\r\n3. `Bound.lean` currently imports `Mathlib.Analysis.Analytic.Basic` just to add `r_pos` as a forward rule.  If this rule is reasonable it would of course be better to move that to `Mathlib.Analysis.Analytic.Basic` to remove the heavy import.\r\n4. I added two more triangle inequalities in a separate PR (which also shows up as a commit within this one until that other PR is dealt with):\r\n\r\n- [x] depends on: https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/10561 [extra triangle inequalities]\r\n\r\n[![Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io/from-referrer/)\r\n",

Will reply to them soon, but wanted to leave a separate thought here before I forget it.\r\n\r\nCurrently one has to manually map each lemma to the appropriate rule type and priority, but I think this could be mostly automated:\r\n\r\n1. Have a single `bound` attribute that all the lemmas are registered to.\r\n2. For each, count the number of (1) general inequality hypotheses and (2) positivity/nonnegativity hypotheses, then map to priority based on lexicographic ordering of (1) and (2). \r\n\r\nDoes that seem reasonable?  I can make that refactoring if so, and it would make it way easier to register new bound lemmas. ",

The first match I tried to convert was `~q(@OfNat.ofNat.{u} _ 0 $i)`, but using an explicit `0` was a syntax error for `match_expr`, and I can't find any literal matching in the `lean4` repo.

It seems like you would want some sort of multiplicative penalty for anything that requires branching. I don't think this is enough of a problem to hold up the PR, but in case we have performance issues as a result of branching, I think this is a good place to look for the culprit in the future.",

Will reply to them soon, but wanted to leave a separate thought here before I forget it.\r\n\r\nCurrently one has to manually map each lemma to the appropriate rule type and priority, but I think this could be mostly automated:\r\n\r\n1. Have a single `bound` attribute that all the lemmas are registered to.\r\n2. For each, count the number of (1) general inequality hypotheses and (2) positivity/nonnegativity hypotheses, then map to priority based on lexicographic ordering of (1) and (2). \r\n\r\nDoes that seem reasonable?  I can make that refactoring if so, and it would make it way easier to register new bound lemmas. ",
