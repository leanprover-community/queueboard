I think the definition I have now for quantales fits best.\r\nAs I explain in the preceding comments, the term is not completely consistent within literature, with some authors\r\nusing it for a semigroup and others using it for a monoid, so we have to decide on which stance Mathlib will take on it.\r\nBut in many papers I actually see it acknowledged that the original is without assuming the unit element, to subsequently\r\nsay: but in this paper we use the term to mean a unital quantale. Therefore, from a Mathlib point of view, I guess it is okay\r\nto drag along the OneQuantale whenever a paper you are formalizing says Quantale.\r\n\r\nThe construct you are proposing would make sense if the general way of looking at it is that \"you turn a semigroup into a quantale\", but (just like with a ring consisting of two semigroups) that is not the way quantales are being used imo.\r\n\r\nThanks for thinking along though! It really helps to have someone giving feedback :-)\r\n",

Instead, you can think of it as: \"a semigroup is the minimal algebraic structure necessary for a quantale\".\n\nJust for comparison, `Module R M` takes two type class arguments: `AddCommMonoid M` and `Semiring R`. So, to get a vector space over a field, you have to write `[AddCommGroup V] [Field K] [Module K V]`.\n\nI would encourage you to throw out preconceptions about how things \"should\" look based on how you think of it before formalization.

There is not a single unique \"minimal structure\" for many things, and the choice for one over another will lead to problems down the road at some point. \r\n\r\nFor example, today I was stuck on understanding idempotent semirings. The textual description says it is a semiring with an idempotent operator - fair enough, just what you would expect. But then the formalization says it is a semiring and a sup-semilattice in which addition coincides with supremum. That is actually a much more assuming (and certainly not minimal) description of it (and it kind-off contradicts the name). In fact, there may be multiple ways to turn a semiring into a sup-semilattice. Indeed, when it is an idempotent semiring, choosing the order to match $$x \\leq y$$ iff $x + y = y$$ is a natural option, but the reverse is always an option as well. \r\n\r\nI don't think the formalization of it all forces one direction or another. But I do understand that in some branches of mathematics people have come to think of the structure in one way (as an algebraic property of the +), and in other branches they think of the same structure in another way (as an order-theoretic property of the +). In this case, the latter group of people got to developing that part of the library first, so the first group of people will have to adapt a bit. Formalization seems to have trouble allowing both sides to be happy on the same footing, unless you are prepared to drag around a lot of references, making both sides unhappy really.",

Sure, there are many ways to put a sup-semilattice on a semiring, it's just that the structures won't be related (and you can do that in Lean).

I may not be expressing myself clearly where my concern really is. \r\n\r\nWhat I ran into during an earlier small project, is that I thought I had defined an arbitrary order structure to work on in combination with an algebraic structure. I had no intention of using the canonical order, which apparently also exists. But only when I got into the proofs I found out Lean interpreted me defining an order structure as well as an algebraic structure as \"oh he means the canonical one\". So all of a sudden I was provided with axioms that I didn't actually want to have and that invalidated my theorem. Luckily, actually, because the same could happen the other way around. If you don't notice that under the hood there is an order structure defined, you might accidentally use that one while the definitions really seem to suggest something else. Such confusions make me quite uncertain when using Lean, so I try to keep control over what is defined and what is not.\r\n\r\nDo you have similar experiences?\r\n",

This would be a pain, and it's probably not what you want. For the others, I'm less sure whether they should be classes, as I don't really know what the use cases are.\r\n\r\nNow, as for a mix-in, this is what these classes would be if you just changed them to `class` instead of `def` right now (and, if you did that, you should explicitly mark their type as `Prop`). A mix-in is a class which takes another class as an argument, but only adds `Prop`-valued fields. An example of this in the library would be `IsDomain`. In contrast, we don't use this pattern everywhere. For example, we don't write `Ring R` with `IsComm R` to specify a commutative ring. Instead, we write `CommRing R`, and the structure `CommRing` instead `extends` the structure `Ring`. This means that a `CommRing` carries with it a ring structure, instead of needing one supplied to it.\r\n\r\nReasons for preferring one to the other are related to convenience, performance or parallelism, or yet other reasons. In this case, I would almost certainly argue that `IsComm` should *not* be a mix-in, if for no other reason than we want the parallelism with the rest of the library. You can read more about the algebraic hierarchy in Mathlib in the book \"Mathematics in Lean\".",

If I let go of that, and in a library you must be able to support all kinds of uses, then it makes sense to just add everything you can reasonably define, and you end up with complete lattices. Thanks... I learned something today :-)",

There is a dictionary for this, which isn't too hard to guess (`one` → `zero`, `mul` → `add`, `pow` → `smul`, etc.). There are edge cases where you need to do something manually, but if you have any trouble, just ask on Zulip.",

I think the definition I have now for quantales fits best.\r\nAs I explain in the preceding comments, the term is not completely consistent within literature, with some authors\r\nusing it for a semigroup and others using it for a monoid, so we have to decide on which stance Mathlib will take on it.\r\nBut in many papers I actually see it acknowledged that the original is without assuming the unit element, to subsequently\r\nsay: but in this paper we use the term to mean a unital quantale. Therefore, from a Mathlib point of view, I guess it is okay\r\nto drag along the OneQuantale whenever a paper you are formalizing says Quantale.\r\n\r\nThe construct you are proposing would make sense if the general way of looking at it is that \"you turn a semigroup into a quantale\", but (just like with a ring consisting of two semigroups) that is not the way quantales are being used imo.\r\n\r\nThanks for thinking along though!

There is not a single unique \"minimal structure\" for many things, and the choice for one over another will lead to problems down the road at some point. \r\n\r\nFor example, today I was stuck on understanding idempotent semirings. The textual description says it is a semiring with an idempotent operator - fair enough, just what you would expect. But then the formalization says it is a semiring and a sup-semilattice in which addition coincides with supremum. That is actually a much more assuming (and certainly not minimal) description of it (and it kind-off contradicts the name). In fact, there may be multiple ways to turn a semiring into a sup-semilattice. Indeed, when it is an idempotent semiring, choosing the order to match $$x \\leq y$$ iff $x + y = y$$ is a natural option, but the reverse is always an option as well. \r\n\r\nI don't think the formalization of it all forces one direction or another. But I do understand that in some branches of mathematics people have come to think of the structure in one way (as an algebraic property of the +), and in other branches they think of the same structure in another way (as an order-theoretic property of the +). In this case, the latter group of people got to developing that part of the library first, so the first group of people will have to adapt a bit. Formalization seems to have trouble allowing both sides to be happy on the same footing, unless you are prepared to drag around a lot of references, making both sides unhappy really.",

I may not be expressing myself clearly where my concern really is. \r\n\r\nWhat I ran into during an earlier small project, is that I thought I had defined an arbitrary order structure to work on in combination with an algebraic structure. I had no intention of using the canonical order, which apparently also exists. But only when I got into the proofs I found out Lean interpreted me defining an order structure as well as an algebraic structure as \"oh he means the canonical one\". So all of a sudden I was provided with axioms that I didn't actually want to have and that invalidated my theorem. Luckily, actually, because the same could happen the other way around. If you don't notice that under the hood there is an order structure defined, you might accidentally use that one while the definitions really seem to suggest something else. Such confusions make me quite uncertain when using Lean, so I try to keep control over what is defined and what is not.\r\n\r\nDo you have similar experiences?\r\n",
