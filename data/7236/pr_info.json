Relatedly, a lot of the API for sums, etc, expects a `Finset` or `Fintype` as domain, so using Finsets gives more seamless access to this API.",

This is a great contribution.\r\n\r\nI am sorry for potentially delaying this even further, but I am going to ask you to make a few changes that I think are low-cost and/or important. Most of them are very minor simplifications to the proofs.\r\n\r\nThank you!",

Relatedly, a lot of the API for sums, etc, expects a `Finset` or `Fintype` as domain, so using Finsets gives more seamless access to this API.",
