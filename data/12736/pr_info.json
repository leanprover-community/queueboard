              "body": "> So if I have it right, the split is essentially:\r\n> * lemmas about `pow` and monoid operations go to `Defs`\r\n> * lemmas about `zpow` or group operations go to `Basic`\r\n> \r\n> ? I suppose that is as good a criterion as any.\r\n\r\nI don't really think that's true. If anything, the `pow`/`zpow` split is a result of `zpow` lemmas generally being harder to prove than their `pow` counterpart and are less \"foundational\" (in that they show up in fewer proofs of basic stuff, in particular default structure fields and forgetful inheritance instances). The actual way I did the split was to put in `Defs` results that looked like existing lemmas from `Defs` so long as they didn't require lemmas in `Basic`, and the rest went to `Basic`. I'm not super happy with the reasoning, but rearranging `Defs` and `Basic` is probably a job for another PR.\r\n\r\n> Is the reason that you want to put these lemmas there because that ensures everyone imports them, or something else?\r\n\r\nBasically yes. More precisely, I want `mul` and `pow` to be on an equal footing import-wise because they mathematically are and because the current situation pushes people to consider `pow` to be a more advanced concept and reflect that in their file structure further downstream: See all the files called `Power` and the folder `Algebra.GroupPower`. For now, I am waging war against the latter, because it is the mother of almost all import oddities I have found in the past two months, eg what I am fixing in #11863 or the import that @grunweg tried removing in #12714.\r\n\r\n> I'm not convinced that making a huge `Group.Basic` / `Group.Defs` file is the best way to go\r\n\r\nTo me, that's a second-order problem. Once we have put `mul` and `pow` on an equal footing import-wise, we can think about stratifying the files about them, but *not* along the `mul` vs `pow` axis. I don't have a specific suggestion there, but [that thread](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/287929-mathlib4/topic/Reducing.20imports.20to.20Algebra.2ECharP.2EBasic/near/437475724) gave a few ideas. All I want is for this brain-storming to happen *after* I have annihilated `Algebra.GroupPower`, so that we don't overfit the file structure to a `pow`erless library.",

I suppose that is as good a criterion as any.\r\n\r\nAgain I'm not convinced that making a huge `Group.Basic` / `Group.Defs` file is the best way to go but I agree that moving the power lemmas upstream is a good idea. So I'm still willing to be convinced. Is the reason that you want to put these lemmas there because that ensures everyone imports them, or something else?",

I suppose that is as good a criterion as any.\r\n\r\nI don't really think that's true. If anything, the `pow`/`zpow` split is a result of `zpow` lemmas generally being harder to prove than their `pow` counterpart and are less \"foundational\" (in that they show up in fewer proofs of basic stuff, in particular default structure fields and forgetful inheritance instances). The actual way I did the split was to put in `Defs` results that looked like existing lemmas from `Defs` so long as they didn't require lemmas in `Basic`, and the rest went to `Basic`. I'm not super happy with the reasoning, but rearranging `Defs` and `Basic` is probably a job for another PR.\r\n\r\n> Is the reason that you want to put these lemmas there because that ensures everyone imports them, or something else?\r\n\r\nBasically yes. More precisely, I want `mul` and `pow` to be on an equal footing import-wise because they mathematically are and because the current situation pushes people to consider `pow` to be a more advanced concept and reflect that in their file structure further downstream: See all the files called `Power` and the folder `Algebra.GroupPower`. For now, I am waging war against the latter, because it is the mother of almost all import oddities I have found in the past two months, eg what I am fixing in #11863 or the import that @grunweg tried removing in #12714.\r\n\r\n> I'm not convinced that making a huge `Group.Basic` / `Group.Defs` file is the best way to go\r\n\r\nTo me, that's a second-order problem. Once we have put `mul` and `pow` on an equal footing import-wise, we can think about stratifying the files about them, but *not* along the `mul` vs `pow` axis. I don't have a specific suggestion there, but [that thread](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/287929-mathlib4/topic/Reducing.20imports.20to.20Algebra.2ECharP.2EBasic/near/437475724) gave a few ideas. All I want is for this brain-storming to happen *after* I have annihilated `Algebra.GroupPower`, so that we don't overfit the file structure to a `pow`erless library.",
