Some of the cases of `apply_fun` have more sophisticated elaboration routines to be able to propagate type information, and there's also a routine for trying to prove Injective that's not being used in this PR's code (that's fine). You could take a look at how the other Injective is elaborated, and we could try to make more uniform code.\r\n\r\nI think the reason the type ascription's needed is that it's using `Tactic.elabTerm` instead of `Term.elabTerm`, but we can't just switch from one to the other without being sure to synthesize pending metavariables.\r\n\r\nAnyway, this would all be for a future PR.",

Some of the cases of `apply_fun` have more sophisticated elaboration routines to be able to propagate type information, and there's also a routine for trying to prove Injective that's not being used in this PR's code (that's fine). You could take a look at how the other Injective is elaborated, and we could try to make more uniform code.\r\n\r\nI think the reason the type ascription's needed is that it's using `Tactic.elabTerm` instead of `Term.elabTerm`, but we can't just switch from one to the other without being sure to synthesize pending metavariables.\r\n\r\nAnyway, this would all be for a future PR.",
