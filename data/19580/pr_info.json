More broadly, comparability and incomparability both show up, I'd rather define comparability and write incomparability as \"not comparable\" vs defining incomparability and writing comparability as \"not incomparable\". \r\n\r\nBut to say a bit more about the use of (either one of) these relations, these notions show up reasonably often when working with preorders and partial orders, in fact [IsChain](https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/Mathlib/Order/Chain.html#IsChain) takes in something exactly like this (and gets used in every Zorn argument in Lean). To me, `CompRel` in a partial order plays the same role as [Commute](https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/Mathlib/Algebra/Group/Commute/Defs.html#Commute) does in a ring (if every pair is CompRel we have a linear order, if every pair is Commute we have a commring). \r\n\r\nAnd to tie both of these together, if we have `CompRel` then we can write `IsChain` in terms of that.",

More broadly, comparability and incomparability both show up, I'd rather define comparability and write incomparability as \"not comparable\" vs defining incomparability and writing comparability as \"not incomparable\". \r\n\r\nBut to say a bit more about the use of (either one of) these relations, these notions show up reasonably often when working with preorders and partial orders, in fact [IsChain](https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/Mathlib/Order/Chain.html#IsChain) takes in something exactly like this (and gets used in every Zorn argument in Lean). To me, `CompRel` in a partial order plays the same role as [Commute](https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/Mathlib/Algebra/Group/Commute/Defs.html#Commute) does in a ring (if every pair is CompRel we have a linear order, if every pair is Commute we have a commring). \r\n\r\nAnd to tie both of these together, if we have `CompRel` then we can write `IsChain` in terms of that.",

If I'm going to be writing things in terms of `¬ CompRel` then I can't use dot notation, which is annoying. Writing e.g. `IncompRel.not_le` is much nicer than writing `not_le_of_not_compRel`.",
