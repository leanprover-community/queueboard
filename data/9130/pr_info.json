So anyway, I proved that continuous multilinear maps are analytic, however, to deduce that they are differentiable, I need the target space F to be complete ! At least that's a hypothesis in [AnalyticAt.contDiffAt](https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/Mathlib/Analysis/Calculus/FDeriv/Analytic.html#AnalyticAt.contDiffAt), I haven't checked whether it's possible to remove it. \r\nBut my old proof works without that extra hypothesis on F !

Maybe we could generalize it to analytic functions with finitely many nonzero terms (\"polynomial functions\"?).

When `a` only differ from `b` on a Finset `s`, all summands outside of `s` would vanish by linearity, and you get a sum over `s.card` terms, and I think you can still get estimates as easily. Choosing an Equiv between `ι` and some `Fin n` is also a good idea, like Eric suggested. ",

As `f` is a map from `(i : ι) → M₁ i` to `M₂`, the nth term of the FormalMultilinearSeries must be a multilinear map on `Fin n →((i : ι) → M₁ i)` (and then we evaluate it on the diagonal when we sum).

(In characteristic 0, I could just take the symmetrization of the thing I defined and divide by `n!`.)\r\nAs for the original question, yes, I could start by defining a multilinear map on `(i : s) → M₁ i` and build the nth derivative from that.

So anyway, I proved that continuous multilinear maps are analytic, however, to deduce that they are differentiable, I need the target space F to be complete ! At least that's a hypothesis in [AnalyticAt.contDiffAt](https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/Mathlib/Analysis/Calculus/FDeriv/Analytic.html#AnalyticAt.contDiffAt), I haven't checked whether it's possible to remove it. \r\nBut my old proof works without that extra hypothesis on F ! So I guess I should still PR it, and also PR the proof that continuous multilinear maps are analytic, now that it's written ?",

I only just worked out the informal argument why a continuous multilinear form f (of finitely many factors) is analytic; you need to compose it with the (linear) projections to obtain f(p1, ..., pn) and put that as the nth term in the power series.

Maybe we could generalize it to analytic functions with finitely many nonzero terms (\"polynomial functions\"?).
