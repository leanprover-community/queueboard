This comes from the fact that a standard way of *proving* that `UniqueProds` holds for `X`, is to put an order on `X` and extract mins or maxs from `Finset`s of `X`.\r\n\r\nHowever, the statement of `UniqueProds` makes no reference to a background order.  All of this is to say that, when you are putting an arbitrary order on something, just to prove `UniqueProds` it is probably an indication that a previous lemma that I put in the library assumed an order, but it could have been generalised to something without an order!",

This comes from the fact that a standard way of *proving* that `UniqueProds` holds for `X`, is to put an order on `X` and extract mins or maxs from `Finset`s of `X`.\r\n\r\nHowever, the statement of `UniqueProds` makes no reference to a background order.  All of this is to say that, when you are putting an arbitrary order on something, just to prove `UniqueProds` it is probably an indication that a previous lemma that I put in the library assumed an order, but it could have been generalised to something without an order!",
