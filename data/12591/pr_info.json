Right now we have it under the hypothesis of the two measures having a Lebesgue decomposition, and we have the existence of that decomposition only when they are *both* sigma-finite. My plan is to deduce the more general RN theorem from this PR (and several other PRs to come, proving among others the existence of the rho in your argument).",

By Radon-Nikodym, one may write `μ.withDensity f` as a measure with density wrt rho, with some measurable density. And then you can apply your first lemma.",

My plan is to deduce the more general RN theorem from this PR (and several other PRs to come, proving among others the existence of the rho in your argument).",

I will add a TODO and keep only the result for measurable instead of ae-measurable for now.\r\nThis auxiliary lemma will then be used to prove that every measure absolutely continuous with respect to an s-finite measure is s-finite, and at that point I'll come back to this to add an instance for s-finiteness of `μ.withDensity f`.",
