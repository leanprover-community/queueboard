AIUI, this PR aims to solve the following problem: a PR introduces an unexpected regression, that is only caught by benchmarking it after merging --- and might go entirely unnoticed, because there is no process to flag such regressions, and to follow up on such PRs. Addressing this would be nice!\r\n\r\nBenchmarking every PR prior to landing does help for that, I agree --- but also feels like a very blunt tool. (I does put lots of strain on the current benchmarking runners, and I would expect the number of mathlib PRs to go up, not down, in the future.)\r\nHave you considered different solutions? For instance: analysing these logs afterwards and trying to flag PRs automatically with \"interesting changes\", for a human to look at? (In general, that seems like a difficult problem --- adding new results generally increases instructions, after all --- but just catching \"big regressions\" should be easy still.)\r\nOr are you thinking that the \"human time\" spent on such a tool is more expensive than CI time? (That's a fair argument.)\r\n\r\n\r\nTo clarify: I'm not opposed to this decision, but I'd like to understand better why you feel this way.",

AIUI, this PR aims to solve the following problem: a PR introduces an unexpected regression, that is only caught by benchmarking it after merging --- and might go entirely unnoticed, because there is no process to flag such regressions, and to follow up on such PRs. Addressing this would be nice!\r\n\r\nBenchmarking every PR prior to landing does help for that, I agree --- but also feels like a very blunt tool. (I does put lots of strain on the current benchmarking runners, and I would expect the number of mathlib PRs to go up, not down, in the future.)\r\nHave you considered different solutions? For instance: analysing these logs afterwards and trying to flag PRs automatically with \"interesting changes\", for a human to look at? (In general, that seems like a difficult problem --- adding new results generally increases instructions, after all --- but just catching \"big regressions\" should be easy still.)\r\nOr are you thinking that the \"human time\" spent on such a tool is more expensive than CI time? (That's a fair argument.)\r\n\r\n\r\nTo clarify: I'm not opposed to this decision, but I'd like to understand better why you feel this way.",
