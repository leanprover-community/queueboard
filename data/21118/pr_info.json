But I don't love the idea that we'll perpetually be forced to choose a default model structure on each category. In particular, when it comes time to construct model structures on diagram categories do we pick the projective model structure as default (privileging homotopy colimits, in a sense) or the injective one (privileging homotopy limits)? Both are equally important. \r\n\r\nI think of the constructions of the projective/injective model structure as operations that take in a category with a model structure plus an indexing category and return a model structure on diagrams, when it exists. (Really I think of these as operations on the weak factorization systems, moreso than on the model structure, as Joël and I have discussed elsewhere.)\r\n\r\nChain complexes (over a ring where not all modules are projective, not a field) is another example where it's not clear to me there is a default model structure that's optimal for all applications (connecting homotopical to homological algebra).",

When I read your code I was momentarily confused by this and thought the scope was a general \"quillen model category\" namespace rather than a specific \"Quillen model structure\" namespace.\r\n\r\nFinally, should \"Quillen\" be capitalized (as a proper name)?

              "body": "I'll concede that my point of view is less standard concerning the category of simplicial sets (using the Joyal model structure more than the Quillen one). But I don't love the idea that we'll perpetually be forced to choose a default model structure on each category. In particular, when it comes time to construct model structures on diagram categories do we pick the projective model structure as default (privileging homotopy colimits, in a sense) or the injective one (privileging homotopy limits)? Both are equally important. \r\n\r\nI think of the constructions of the projective/injective model structure as operations that take in a category with a model structure plus an indexing category and return a model structure on diagrams, when it exists. (Really I think of these as operations on the weak factorization systems, moreso than on the model structure, as Joël and I have discussed elsewhere.)\r\n\r\nChain complexes (over a ring where not all modules are projective, not a field) is another example where it's not clear to me there is a default model structure that's optimal for all applications (connecting homotopical to homological algebra).",
