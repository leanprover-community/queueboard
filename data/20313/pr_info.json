        "body": "This PR proves two basic results about the complex exponential:\r\n* `abs_exp_mul_I (x : ℂ) : abs (Complex.exp (I * x)) = Real.exp (-x.im)`\r\n* `one_sub_rexp_re_le_abs_one_sub_cexp (x : ℂ) : 1 - Real.exp x.re ≤ Complex.abs (1 - Complex.exp x)`\r\nBoth results were proved as part of the sphere packing project. There's a chance they're too specific for mathlib, but I thought they were worth PRing anyway. Would it also be a good idea to tag `abs_exp_mul_I` with `simp`? Feedback/suggestions welcome.\r\n\r\nNote: `one_sub_rexp_re_le_abs_one_sub_cexp` was proved by Bhavik Mehta @b-mehta \r\n\r\n---\r\n<!-- The text above the `---` will become the commit message when your\r\nPR is merged.

Perhaps we can create a folder called Exponential to replace the file. We can then split this file into two files that live inside that folder, one with the definitions of the various functions defined (lines 24-146) and another with the statements about these functions. If we want, the file with all the statements can be further subdivided into files like \"Basic\" and such, each roughly corresponding to a part of the file where one namespace is closed and another is opened. Another (and possibly more sensible, if also more laborious) way of splitting it up would be to group together lemmas about each of the functions defined, though there is a bit of overlap... in any case, just having two files would solve the _immediate_ problem of having a file over 1500 lines long, but if we can expect to merge more results about the exponential and related functions, it might be good to divide the files up.",

What do you think would be a good way of doing this?\r\n\r\nI'm a fairly new contributor to Mathlib, but I do have a few thoughts. Perhaps we can create a folder called Exponential to replace the file. We can then split this file into two files that live inside that folder, one with the definitions of the various functions defined (lines 24-146) and another with the statements about these functions. If we want, the file with all the statements can be further subdivided into files like \"Basic\" and such, each roughly corresponding to a part of the file where one namespace is closed and another is opened. Another (and possibly more sensible, if also more laborious) way of splitting it up would be to group together lemmas about each of the functions defined, though there is a bit of overlap... in any case, just having two files would solve the _immediate_ problem of having a file over 1500 lines long, but if we can expect to merge more results about the exponential and related functions, it might be good to divide the files up.",

What do you think would be a good way of doing this?\r\n> \r\n> I'm a fairly new contributor to Mathlib, but I do have a few thoughts. Perhaps we can create a folder called Exponential to replace the file. We can then split this file into two files that live inside that folder, one with the definitions of the various functions defined (lines 24-146) and another with the statements about these functions. If we want, the file with all the statements can be further subdivided into files like \"Basic\" and such, each roughly corresponding to a part of the file where one namespace is closed and another is opened. Another (and possibly more sensible, if also more laborious) way of splitting it up would be to group together lemmas about each of the functions defined, though there is a bit of overlap... in any case, just having two files would solve the _immediate_ problem of having a file over 1500 lines long, but if we can expect to merge more results about the exponential and related functions, it might be good to divide the files up.\r\n\r\nI think starting with the two file split is best, as Exponential/Defs and Exponential/Lemmas, and then feel invited in a subsequent PR to split Lemmas further!",
