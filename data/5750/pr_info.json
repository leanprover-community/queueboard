        "body": "This PR introduces two classes `ContinuousFunctionalCalculus` and `UniqueContinuousFunctionalCalculus`. The former provides a collection of star algebra homomoprhisms from the continuous functions on the spectrum of an element `a : A`, into the algebra `A` itself, subject to the constraint that `a` satisfies a certain predicate `p : A → Prop`. These morphisms are continuous (even closed embeddings) and send the identity function to `a` itself, and moreover, the spectrum of the image of an element is its range.\r\n\r\nThe latter class says that there is at most one such star algebra homomorphism which is continuous and maps the identity to `a`; in practice, this is a consequence of the Stone-Weierstrass theorem, but we create a separate class because we will also want a version for `ℝ≥0`-valued functions. This latter class is the key to establish the compositional property of the continuous functional calculus, `cfc_comp : cfc a (g ∘ f) = cfc (cfc a f) g`. This is one of the key properties of the continuous functional calculus that makes it useful.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nNote to reviewers: this PR has been completely overhauled, so none of the messages ‌/ reviews prior to 2024-02-19 are relevant.\r\n\r\nAlso, any line labeled `-- hack` is there to make `fun_prop` see through the `autoParam`.

When proving that, you need to construct a CFC in the middle of the proof, then you use that it is a subsingleton to say that the one you constructed is equal to the one you already have. However, since the subsingleton property holds for `Core` we can do less work in the construction.\n\nNote: I am also keen to use the `Subsingleton` proof because we will be able to supply an instance when the scalars are `NNReal` too, even though right now the only one we have is for `IsROrC`.",

              "body": "I spent some time thinking about how I would do this, here's a summary of my (untested!) ideas. Some of them are probably overkill but I still want to write them down somewhere, and I hope at least some of it will be useful. Also disclaimer that I'm probably not familiar enough with the material to avoid making some silly mistake, sorry in advance!\r\n\r\nMy first and main idea is to have a class `FunctionalCalculus R F a X` expressing that the `R` (?)-algebra `F` (which is morally an algebra of functions) on the element `a : A`, where `A` is a `R` (?)-algebra, and that this functional calculus maps some distinguished element `X : F` to `a`. Under this assumption, we would be able to write `fc R a f` for any `f : F`.\r\nHere (?)-algebra means that we have to think about what assumptions we put on the algebra. We also get to choose properties of the functional calculus (the bare minimum being of course algebra homomorphism), and depending on the level of generality we choose we'll be able to state some of the followings:\r\n- when `A` is a C*-algebra and `a : A` is star-normal, we can have two instances encompassing both your `cfc₁` and `cfc₂`, namely `FunctionalCalculus R C(spectrum R a, R) a X.toContinuousMapOn` as well as `FunctionalCalculus R C(R, R) a X.toContinuousMap` [1]. That means that we can kind of unify the APIs, at least for the user perspective (we still need to define all of the instances twice though). This also means that, even if we don't want it as an global instance, a user could add instances of `FunctionalCalculus R C(T, R) a X.toContinuousMapOn` if they know that `T` contains the spectrum of `a`. [2]\r\n- if we don't impose too strong continuity assumption, this same setup could apply to the borel functional calculus.\r\n- if we don't ask for unital algebras, this same setup could apply to the continuous functional calculus of non-unital C*-algebras [3]\r\n- I'm not sure how useful it is, but we can make an instance for polynomials :sweat_smile: It may be convenient if we want to use some general composition setup, see below.\r\n\r\nOf course this doesn't allow for a lot of factoring in the actual mathematical content, because a lot of properties will only work for one functional calculus. But the point is that, for the user, it provides a more unified experience and less lemma names to remember (and less chance that we forget stating a result for only one of the calculi).\r\n\r\nThe next step is figuring how to state and prove the spectrum and composition properties in this setup. I think from the user point of view, the most basic version would be to have the following two mixins:\r\n- `MapsSpectrum R F x im`, where `im : F -> Set R` [4], saying that the spectrum of `fc R a f` is exactly `im f`. Typically `im` would be the range of f / f(Sp a) / the essential range of f.\r\n- `CompFCClass R f1 a cmp`, where `f1 : F1`, `cmp F2 -> F3`, `[FunctionalCalculus R F1 a X1]`, `[FunctionalCalculus R F3 a X3]`, `[FunctionalCalculus R F2 (fc R f1 a) X2]`, saying that for all `f2 : F2`, we have `fc R (fc R a f1) f2 = fc R a (cmp f2)`. Typically, cmp would be pre-composition by `f1`. The nice thing is that, from the user perspective there'd be exactly one lemma for your three existing versions [EDIT: actually it doesn't quite work for the full `cfc₁` version, because C(spectrum R a, spectrum R (cfc₁ f a)) is not an algebra], because we still, and the same lemma could also apply to compositions between continuous and borel functional calculi for example. The not-so-nice thing is that you still have to provide all of these instances by hand. This leads me to my other idea.\r\n\r\nThis second idea is a way of systematizing the proofs of composition properties, either in the context of the aforementioned `CompFCClass` or just for proving manual lemmas. This can be adapted to be independent of the previous idea if necessary. We would have a class/structure `UniqueFunctionalCalculus R F a X p q` [5] where `p : FunctionalCalculus R F a X -> Prop` adds additional restrictions to the functional calculus (typically continuity if we don't require it in `FunctionalCalculus` and `q : F -> F -> Prop` is a relation of functions. This would be defined as \"given two functional calculi `φ` and `ψ` satisfying `p`, and which are compatible with the relation `q`, then they are equal\". In the unital CFC case, we would have the usual `UniqueFunctionalCalculus R C(spectrum R a, R) a X.toContinuousMapOn continuous (· = ·)`, but also `UniqueFunctionalCalculus R C(R, R) a X.toContinuousMap continuous (EqOn (spectrum R A))` giving some kind of uniqueness result for `cfc₂`. Using that we can write a \"composition factory\" lemma to prove the composition property purely by verifying that the predicate `p` and the relation `q` behave \"nicely\" under our composition operation, whatever it is.  (I'll edit it in there later, I need some time to write this lemma properly).\r\n\r\nAgain, this is probably overkill, but the semilinear maps API suggest that it is at least possible, and I wanted to write in completely somewhere if we decide to pick some ideas from it in the future.\r\n\r\nFootnotes:\r\n- [1] using `Polynomial.toContinuousMap[On]` seems a bit weird, using `ContinuousMap.id` seems easier but I don't know if we have a name for the inclusion map as a bundled `ContinuousMap`\r\n- [2] I think we could also use the freedom given by the choice of algebra to take care some of the \"change of base ring\" stuff, but I haven't thought about it enough.\r\n- [3] if we do so we'll probably need a `UnitalFunctionalCalculus` typeclass that extends `FunctionalCalculus`, and we could have notations like `fcₙ` for the non-unital one and `fc` for the unital one\r\n- [4] would be an `OutParam`",

Problem 1: `g.comp f` is meaningless because the domains and codomains no longer coincide. One option would be to restrict the codomain of `f` to the domain of `g`, but that leads to Problem 2: for the RHS to make sense we need to have `g : C(spectrum R (cfc₁ R a f), R)`, but then that would mean the codomain of `f` (if it were to coincide with the domain of `g`) would depend on `f` itself.\r\n\r\nIn order to really make this work, you need to do something like:\r\n```lean\r\nlemma cfc₁_comp (f' : C(spectrum R a, R)) (g : C(spectrum R (cfc₂ R a f'), R)\r\n    (f : C(spectrum R a, spectrum R (cfc₂ R a f')) (hff' : ∀ x, (f x : R) = f' x) :  \r\n    cfc₁ R a (g.comp f) = cfc₁ R (cfc₁ R a f') g :=\r\n  sorry\r\n```\r\n",

That is, we have [Continuous.mul](https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/Mathlib/Topology/Algebra/Monoid.html#Continuous.mul), but no `Continuous.mul'` variant.\r\n\r\nI guess the question is: can we uniformize across the library on a particular version, do we just need better automation, or is Yaël right that we need both versions everywhere (:cry: that's a lot of duplication).\r\n\r\n(Also note, this isn't beta reduction, because that would need to be applied to an argument.)",

              "body": "I spent some time thinking about how I would do this, here's a summary of my (untested!) ideas. Some of them are probably overkill but I still want to write them down somewhere, and I hope at least some of it will be useful. Also disclaimer that I'm probably not familiar enough with the material to avoid making some silly mistake, sorry in advance!\r\n\r\nMy first and main idea is to have a class `FunctionalCalculus R F a X` expressing that the `R` (?)-algebra `F` (which is morally an algebra of functions) on the element `a : A`, where `A` is a `R` (?)-algebra, and that this functional calculus maps some distinguished element `X : F` to `a`. Under this assumption, we would be able to write `fc R a f` for any `f : F`.\r\nHere (?)-algebra means that we have to think about what assumptions we put on the algebra. We also get to choose properties of the functional calculus (the bare minimum being of course algebra homomorphism), and depending on the level of generality we choose we'll be able to state some of the followings:\r\n- when `A` is a C*-algebra and `a : A` is star-normal, we can have two instances encompassing both your `cfc₁` and `cfc₂`, namely `FunctionalCalculus R C(spectrum R a, R) a X.toContinuousMapOn` as well as `FunctionalCalculus R C(R, R) a X.toContinuousMap` [1]. That means that we can kind of unify the APIs, at least for the user perspective (we still need to define all of the instances twice though). This also means that, even if we don't want it as an global instance, a user could add instances of `FunctionalCalculus R C(T, R) a X.toContinuousMapOn` if they know that `T` contains the spectrum of `a`. [2]\r\n- if we don't impose too strong continuity assumption, this same setup could apply to the borel functional calculus.\r\n- if we don't ask for unital algebras, this same setup could apply to the continuous functional calculus of non-unital C*-algebras [3]\r\n- I'm not sure how useful it is, but we can make an instance for polynomials :sweat_smile: It may be convenient if we want to use some general composition setup, see below.\r\n\r\nOf course this doesn't allow for a lot of factoring in the actual mathematical content, because a lot of properties will only work for one functional calculus. But the point is that, for the user, it provides a more unified experience and less lemma names to remember (and less chance that we forget stating a result for only one of the calculi).\r\n\r\nThe next step is figuring how to state and prove the spectrum and composition properties in this setup. I think from the user point of view, the most basic version would be to have the following two mixins:\r\n- `MapsSpectrum R F x im`, where `im : F -> Set R` [4], saying that the spectrum of `fc R a f` is exactly `im f`. Typically `im` would be the range of f / f(Sp a) / the essential range of f.\r\n- `CompFCClass R f1 a cmp`, where `f1 : F1`, `cmp F2 -> F3`, `[FunctionalCalculus R F1 a X1]`, `[FunctionalCalculus R F3 a X3]`, `[FunctionalCalculus R F2 (fc R f1 a) X2]`, saying that for all `f2 : F2`, we have `fc R (fc R a f1) f2 = fc R a (cmp f2)`. Typically, cmp would be pre-composition by `f1`. The nice thing is that, from the user perspective there'd be exactly one lemma for your three existing versions [EDIT: actually it doesn't quite work for the full `cfc₁` version, because C(spectrum R a, spectrum R (cfc₁ f a)) is not an algebra], because we still, and the same lemma could also apply to compositions between continuous and borel functional calculi for example. The not-so-nice thing is that you still have to provide all of these instances by hand. This leads me to my other idea.\r\n\r\nThis second idea is a way of systematizing the proofs of composition properties, either in the context of the aforementioned `CompFCClass` or just for proving manual lemmas. This can be adapted to be independent of the previous idea if necessary. We would have a class/structure `UniqueFunctionalCalculus R F a X p q` [5] where `p : FunctionalCalculus R F a X -> Prop` adds additional restrictions to the functional calculus (typically continuity if we don't require it in `FunctionalCalculus` and `q : F -> F -> Prop` is a relation of functions. This would be defined as \"given two functional calculi `φ` and `ψ` satisfying `p`, and which are compatible with the relation `q`, then they are equal\". In the unital CFC case, we would have the usual `UniqueFunctionalCalculus R C(spectrum R a, R) a X.toContinuousMapOn continuous (· = ·)`, but also `UniqueFunctionalCalculus R C(R, R) a X.toContinuousMap continuous (EqOn (spectrum R A))` giving some kind of uniqueness result for `cfc₂`. Using that we can write a \"composition factory\" lemma to prove the composition property purely by verifying that the predicate `p` and the relation `q` behave \"nicely\" under our composition operation, whatever it is.  (I'll edit it in there later, I need some time to write this lemma properly).\r\n\r\nAgain, this is probably overkill, but the semilinear maps API suggest that it is at least possible, and I wanted to write in completely somewhere if we decide to pick some ideas from it in the future.\r\n\r\nFootnotes:\r\n- [1] using `Polynomial.toContinuousMap[On]` seems a bit weird, using `ContinuousMap.id` seems easier but I don't know if we have a name for the inclusion map as a bundled `ContinuousMap`\r\n- [2] I think we could also use the freedom given by the choice of algebra to take care some of the \"change of base ring\" stuff, but I haven't thought about it enough.\r\n- [3] if we do so we'll probably need a `UnitalFunctionalCalculus` typeclass that extends `FunctionalCalculus`, and we could have notations like `fcₙ` for the non-unital one and `fc` for the unital one\r\n- [4] would be an `OutParam`",

Among functional calculi that people use, no, but if you take a non-compact set `s` to replace the spectrum and look at all continuous functions (not just those vanishing at infinity), then I think it likely won't be unique (because Stone--Weierstrass doesn't apply). So, with the type class assumptions that we have available I don't think it's provable, because for compactness of the spectrum we'd need a Banach algebra.\r\n\r\nAnd I think the reason no one uses it if it isn't uniquely determined is that the composition property won't be provable (probably).\r\n\r\nI'm not sure whether this adequately answers your question or not.",
