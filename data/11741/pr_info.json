It seems likely to give merge conflicts.\r\n\r\nI'm not convinced this move is the best way to go: `List.BigOperators.Basic` is (turning into) a random assortment of lemmas, I definitely have trouble parsing its internal structure. Moreover, feel like `Finset.prod` requires way too many imports already and this PR looks like that amount will increase even more.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the alternative would be lots of files named e.g. `Algebra.BigOperators.List.Dedup` that contain only a few results each is also an unsatisfying outcome.
