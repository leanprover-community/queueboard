              "body": "I think what's happening is that because you are the first to define the topology of projective space, everything is missing. So the total amount of work to get to a situation where you can apply `OnePoint.equivOfIsEmbeddingOfRangeEq` will indeed be quite a few lines (and possibly more than your original work). However, the key point is that with the approach I am pushing, almost all of the work will be \"general theory\", and not specific to your end result. This will therefore enrich the library much more than adding one isolated result (and will also be much easier to maintain).\r\n\r\nI would advocate splitting out a new PR from this one, which just sets up the topology on projective space and proves a few basic properties. You could create a new file `Mathlib.Topology.Instances.Projectivization` and add things like:\r\n```lean\r\nopen scoped LinearAlgebra.Projectivization\r\n\r\n-- Let `K` be a topological division ring\r\n-- (for later results, may need `NormedDivisionRing K` instead)\r\nvariable {K : Type*}\r\n  [DivisionRing K] [TopologicalSpace K] [TopologicalDivisionRing K]\r\n\r\n-- Let `V` be a topological vector space over `K`\r\nvariable {V : Type*}\r\n  [AddCommGroup V] [Module K V]\r\n  [TopologicalSpace V] [T2Space V] [ContinuousAdd V] [ContinuousSMul K V]\r\n\r\ninstance : TopologicalSpace (ℙ K V) := instTopologicalSpaceQuot\r\ninstance : T2Space (ℙ K V) := sorry\r\ninstance [FiniteDimensional K V] : CompactSpace (ℙ K V) := sorry\r\n```\r\n\r\nOnce that is done, the next step will be to see what lemmas we have about linear / affine maps (and continuous linear / affine maps) and the induced topology. Ultimately you will be applying this to the map `ℝ → ℝ × ℝ` that sends `x ↦ (x, 1)` but we will want to develop (or if we are lucky, locate) the results quite generally.\r\n\r\nOnce these two components are in place, only then will we bring the pieces together use `OnePoint.equivOfIsEmbeddingOfRangeEq` and if we have done our job above well, all proofs should be short and easy.",

I don't know how to prove your `instance : T2Space (ℙ K V) ` above though.\r\n\r\nI hoped I might get back to this over the weekend, but unfortunately I did not have any time. The short answer is that the `T2Space` instance follows because `ℙ K V` is locally homeomorphic to a codimension-one subspace of `V` (given a line in `V`, use [Submodule.complementedLattice](https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/Mathlib/LinearAlgebra/Basis/VectorSpace.html#Submodule.complementedLattice) to choose such a subspace and argue from there; on second thought if `L` is the line, it might be better to work with the quotient `V ⧸ L` rather than the complementary submodule).\r\n\r\nUnfortunately I probably won't have much time till next weekend but of course there's always Zulip!",

              "body": "I think what's happening is that because you are the first to define the topology of projective space, everything is missing. So the total amount of work to get to a situation where you can apply `OnePoint.equivOfIsEmbeddingOfRangeEq` will indeed be quite a few lines (and possibly more than your original work). However, the key point is that with the approach I am pushing, almost all of the work will be \"general theory\", and not specific to your end result. This will therefore enrich the library much more than adding one isolated result (and will also be much easier to maintain).\r\n\r\nI would advocate splitting out a new PR from this one, which just sets up the topology on projective space and proves a few basic properties. You could create a new file `Mathlib.Topology.Instances.Projectivization` and add things like:\r\n```lean\r\nopen scoped LinearAlgebra.Projectivization\r\n\r\n-- Let `K` be a topological division ring\r\n-- (for later results, may need `NormedDivisionRing K` instead)\r\nvariable {K : Type*}\r\n  [DivisionRing K] [TopologicalSpace K] [TopologicalDivisionRing K]\r\n\r\n-- Let `V` be a topological vector space over `K`\r\nvariable {V : Type*}\r\n  [AddCommGroup V] [Module K V]\r\n  [TopologicalSpace V] [T2Space V] [ContinuousAdd V] [ContinuousSMul K V]\r\n\r\ninstance : TopologicalSpace (ℙ K V) := instTopologicalSpaceQuot\r\ninstance : T2Space (ℙ K V) := sorry\r\ninstance [FiniteDimensional K V] : CompactSpace (ℙ K V) := sorry\r\n```\r\n\r\nOnce that is done, the next step will be to see what lemmas we have about linear / affine maps (and continuous linear / affine maps) and the induced topology. Ultimately you will be applying this to the map `ℝ → ℝ × ℝ` that sends `x ↦ (x, 1)` but we will want to develop (or if we are lucky, locate) the results quite generally.\r\n\r\nOnce these two components are in place, only then will we bring the pieces together use `OnePoint.equivOfIsEmbeddingOfRangeEq` and if we have done our job above well, all proofs should be short and easy.",

I don't know how to prove your `instance : T2Space (ℙ K V) ` above though.\r\n\r\nI hoped I might get back to this over the weekend, but unfortunately I did not have any time. The short answer is that the `T2Space` instance follows because `ℙ K V` is locally homeomorphic to a codimension-one subspace of `V` (given a line in `V`, use [Submodule.complementedLattice](https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/Mathlib/LinearAlgebra/Basis/VectorSpace.html#Submodule.complementedLattice) to choose such a subspace and argue from there; on second thought if `L` is the line, it might be better to work with the quotient `V ⧸ L` rather than the complementary submodule).\r\n\r\nUnfortunately I probably won't have much time till next weekend but of course there's always Zulip!",
