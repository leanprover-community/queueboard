A series $\\sum_{i \\in I} b_i$ unconditionally converges to $b \\in \\beta$ if and only if $\\sum_{i \\in I} g(b_i)$ unconditionally converges to $g(b)$. (That is, if $g$ is inducing, then the converse of `HasProd.map` / `HasSum.map` holds.)\r\n- `Multipliable.map_tprod` / `Summable.map_tsum`: Let $g \\colon \\beta \\to \\alpha$ be a continuous homomorphism of topological additive commutative monoids. If the series $\\sum_{i \\in I} b_i$ converges unconditionally, then $g\\left(\\sum_{i \\in I} b_i\\right) = \\sum_{i \\in I} g(b_i)$.\r\n- `Inducing.multipliable_iff_tprod_comp_mem_range` / `Inducing.summable_iff_tsum_comp_mem_range`: Let $g \\colon \\beta \\to \\alpha$ be an inducing homomorphism of topological additive commutative monoids. Assume that $\\alpha$ is Hausdorff. Then a series $\\sum_{i \\in I} b_i$ converges unconditionally if and only if the series $\\sum_{i \\in I} g(b_i)$ converges unconditionally and its value lies in the range of $g$.\r\n- `hasSum_iff_hasSum_compl`: Let $\\alpha$ be a uniform additive abelian group. An equation $\\sum_{i \\in I} a_i = a$ holds in $\\alpha$ if and only if it holds in $\\hat{\\alpha}$.\r\n- `summable_iff_summable_compl_and_tsum_mem`:  Let $\\alpha$ be a uniform additive abelian group. A series $\\sum_{i \\in I} a_i$ is unconditionally summable in $\\alpha$ if and only if it is unconditionally summable in $\\hat{\\alpha}$ and its value is in $\\alpha$.\r\n- `summable_iff_cauchySeq_finset_and_tsum_mem`: Let $\\alpha$ be a uniform additive abelian group. A series $\\sum_{i \\in I} a_i$ is unconditionally summable in $\\alpha$ if and only if its partial sums form a Cauchy net and its value in $\\hat{\\alpha}$ lies in $\\alpha$.\r\n- `Summable.toCompl_tsum`: If a series $\\sum_{i \\in I} a_i$ is unconditionally summable in $\\alpha$, then its value in $\\alpha$ is equal to its value in $\\hat{\\alpha}$.\r\n\r\nNote: This PR does not include multiplicative analogues of `hasSum_iff_hasSum_compl`, `summable_iff_summable_compl_and_tsum_mem`, `summable_iff_cauchySeq_finset_and_tsum_mem`, or `Summable.toCompl_tsum`. This is because mathlib does not currently put a group structure on the completion of a uniform multiplicative group (see #11837). Once the group structure on the completion of a uniform multiplicative group is defined, the multiplicative analogues of these four theorems can easily be added.\r\n\r\nNote: The argument `(g : G)` of `Multipliable.map_tprod` is explicit to match `Multipliable.map`. At some point, it might be desirable to make these arguments (and several others) implicit, but that is outside the scope of this PR.\r\n\r\n---\r\n<!-- The text above the `---` will become the commit message when your\r\nPR is merged.
