        "body": "This PR adds the types and lemmas for oracle-based computation. In this model, computations are run on a monad which also counts the number of oracle queries executed. With it, it becomes possible to reason about the upper bound of the query complexity of algorithms. In the future, we could extend this work to include the necessary bits from information theory and probability to also reason about lower bounds on query complexity, like the work in https://github.com/girving/debate.\r\n\r\nZulip discussion: https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/channel/144837-PR-reviews/topic/.2318629.20runtime.20complexity.20of.20sorting.20a.20list\r\n\r\nCo-authored-by: Geoffrey Irving <irving@naml.us>\r\n\r\n---\r\n<!-- The text above the `---` will become the commit message when your\r\nPR is merged.

I updated it, but now I don't think we can easily define `value'`, that is, a function that takes a single oracle and runs the computation with it - the function that ignores the input index and always return the same oracle can't be typed, since the domain of the oracle depends on the index. Maybe it is okay to remove this function? (and also `cost'`)",

I updated it, but now I don't think we can easily define `value'`, that is, a function that takes a single oracle and runs the computation with it - the function that ignores the input index and always return the same oracle can't be typed, since the domain of the oracle depends on the index. Maybe it is okay to remove this function? (and also `cost'`)",
