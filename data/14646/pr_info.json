Anyway the linter seems to be suggesting splitting MeasureTheory/Integral/Lebesgue.lean because it has grown too large. This patch adds about 50 lines to that file, which could potentially be moved elsewhere, but the file would still remain large. If a similar amount of code would be added to it on another occasion, the same error would come up. Perhaps it requires some higher level decisions about potentially splitting the file in a fine grained way. I don't feel qualified to decide that.",

I can't count anymore the number of PRs which I should have reviewed but missed because they had a misleading title/a title about other changes that were lumped with the ones I cared about.\r\n\r\nOn a more long-termy note, commits are part of the history of Mathlib forever, so it's definitely worth spending *some* time thinking about how to present things to future git archeologists.

                    "body": "OK, one last comment before the decision is made. The type of `ε` already came up already early on (cf [this comment](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/9163/files#r1493852124)). The one argument I can see in favor of `ε : ENNReal` is that in all the proofs `ε` is always compared with `ENNReal` because that is the target type of [docs#MeasureTheory.snorm](https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/Mathlib/MeasureTheory/Function/LpSeminorm/Basic.html#MeasureTheory.snorm), which makes some internal manipulations easier.\r\n\r\nThe tradeoffs are:\r\n* `ε : Real`: mathematically natural, annoying casts in proofs\r\n* `ε : NNReal`: still mathematically natural, still some (but less annoying) casts in proofs\r\n* `ε : ENNReal`: always check `∞` as a special case (unnatural?), no casts in proofs\r\n\r\nSo, final decision?",

Anyway the linter seems to be suggesting splitting MeasureTheory/Integral/Lebesgue.lean because it has grown too large. This patch adds about 50 lines to that file, which could potentially be moved elsewhere, but the file would still remain large. If a similar amount of code would be added to it on another occasion, the same error would come up. Perhaps it requires some higher level decisions about potentially splitting the file in a fine grained way. I don't feel qualified to decide that.",
