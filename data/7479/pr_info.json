The converse - that this predicate on two indexed families can be extended to a `Dilation` from the first space to the second that maps the first indexed family to the second - is a theorem that holds under appropriate conditions in Euclidean spaces (as discussed on Zulip, existing lemmas about distances and inner products for affine combinations should provide most of what's needed to prove that theorem), but not in more general metric space context.\r\n\r\nOn the whole I think we should probably get #7478 sorted out before this one, though I don't think there's any actual dependency between them.\r\n\r\nNote that the mathlib3 PRs also include various Euclidean results about congruence and similarity for angles and triangles, that haven't been ported to Lean 4 as far as I know (but of course the basic metric space content should be dealt with first).",

The converse - that this predicate on two indexed families can be extended to a `Dilation` from the first space to the second that maps the first indexed family to the second - is a theorem that holds under appropriate conditions in Euclidean spaces (as discussed on Zulip, existing lemmas about distances and inner products for affine combinations should provide most of what's needed to prove that theorem), but not in more general metric space context.\r\n\r\nOn the whole I think we should probably get #7478 sorted out before this one, though I don't think there's any actual dependency between them.\r\n\r\nNote that the mathlib3 PRs also include various Euclidean results about congruence and similarity for angles and triangles, that haven't been ported to Lean 4 as far as I know (but of course the basic metric space content should be dealt with first).",
