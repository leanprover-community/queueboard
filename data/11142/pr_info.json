              "body": "I'll add some brief comments since @YaelDillies pinged me, but I don't have strong opinions here; my interests are in using logic for formalization rather than formalizing logic.\r\n\r\nI am not sure about the value of including a general proof theory library in Mathlib. There is a long tradition of computer scientists formalizing proof-theoretic stuff on the Coq model of doing it in small, independent projects. That's because the formalizations tend not to be very reusable. Projects are generally self-contained and don't depend on one another, and people like to use their own notation and idiosyncratic setups. In other words, people generally prefer to implement the specific logical systems they are interested in from scratch and optimize the implementation to the specific applications they have in mind, rather than taking over infrastructure that someone else has designed. \r\n\r\nTo be clear: I have no objection to merging this PR and indeed no strong opinions either way,  but I am guessing that it won't be a very actively used corner of Mathlib. @digama0 has thought about things like this -- similar questions come up with formalizations of the simply typed lambda calculus -- so I am curious to hear what he thinks. It might be nice to have a canonical proof theory development in Mathlib as a model that others can modify and adapt for their own purposes.\r\n\r\nTwo small comments: logic currently plays a big role in the model theory library, so it's worth asking how this PR fits with the syntax there (https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/Mathlib/ModelTheory/Syntax.html) and whether unifying them will have any benefits. Also: these definitions of conjunction and disjunction over a finset are noncomputable but I can't imagine any applications where conjunction and disjunction aren't AC operations, in which case one can stay computable and use `Finset.fold`.

              "body": "I'll add some brief comments since @YaelDillies pinged me, but I don't have strong opinions here; my interests are in using logic for formalization rather than formalizing logic.\r\n\r\nI am not sure about the value of including a general proof theory library in Mathlib. There is a long tradition of computer scientists formalizing proof-theoretic stuff on the Coq model of doing it in small, independent projects. That's because the formalizations tend not to be very reusable. Projects are generally self-contained and don't depend on one another, and people like to use their own notation and idiosyncratic setups. In other words, people generally prefer to implement the specific logical systems they are interested in from scratch and optimize the implementation to the specific applications they have in mind, rather than taking over infrastructure that someone else has designed. \r\n\r\nTo be clear: I have no objection to merging this PR and indeed no strong opinions either way,  but I am guessing that it won't be a very actively used corner of Mathlib. @digama0 has thought about things like this -- similar questions come up with formalizations of the simply typed lambda calculus -- so I am curious to hear what he thinks. It might be nice to have a canonical proof theory development in Mathlib as a model that others can modify and adapt for their own purposes.\r\n\r\nTwo small comments: logic currently plays a big role in the model theory library, so it's worth asking how this PR fits with the syntax there (https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/Mathlib/ModelTheory/Syntax.html) and whether unifying them will have any benefits. Also: these definitions of conjunction and disjunction over a finset are noncomputable but I can't imagine any applications where conjunction and disjunction aren't AC operations, in which case one can stay computable and use `Finset.fold`.
