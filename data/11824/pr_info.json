You need it three times in this proof (which currently eats close to 30000 heartbeats). E.g.,\r\n```lean\r\n  have hns (a : ℂ) (f : (ℂ × ℂ) →L[ℂ] ℂ) : ‖a • f‖ = ‖a‖ * ‖f‖ :=\r\n    norm_smul a f\r\n```\r\nand then use `hns` three times. `hns` still costs 10000 heartbeats (I think this is because some instances need to be unified [possibly `@instHSMul ℂ (ℂ × ℂ →L[ℂ] ℂ) SMulZeroClass.toSMul =?= @instHSMul ℂ (ℂ × ℂ →L[ℂ] ℂ) ContinuousLinearMap.instSMul`]), but the total goes down by almost 50%.",
