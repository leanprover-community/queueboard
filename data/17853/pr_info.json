Maybe if you write `(h m) • ((- 1) ^ m : R[X]) * X ^ (k + m)` as `C (h m * (-1) ^ m) * X ^ (k + m)` then it can be solve by the linearity of `derivative^[k]` (I'm not sure which theorem it is) and `Polynomial.iterate_derivative_C_mul`.\r\n> \r\n> Maybe you can try `derivative ^ k` instead of `derivative^[k]`, the former is a linear map, but the latter is not; when apply to polynomials, these two are definitionally equal.\r\n\r\nok! thank you for your suggestion. But I see that `derivative^[k] `is used in the front of the document. I'm not sure if I want to change it to `derivative ^ k`?",

Maybe if you write `(h m) • ((- 1) ^ m : R[X]) * X ^ (k + m)` as `C (h m * (-1) ^ m) * X ^ (k + m)` then it can be solve by the linearity of `derivative^[k]` (I'm not sure which theorem it is) and `Polynomial.iterate_derivative_C_mul`.\r\n\r\nMaybe you can try `derivative ^ k` instead of `derivative^[k]`, the former is a linear map, but the latter is not; when apply to polynomials, these two are definitionally equal.",
