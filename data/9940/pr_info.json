One cuestion: why is `constructor` preferable over `apply Iff.intro`?\r\n\r\n`constructor` is a quite general tactic, whereas for the latter, you'd have to name the appropriate structure `Iff.intro`, `And.intro`, which to me feels too low-level, reaching into the implementation details. It's mostly a matter of personal taste, but I think if there's a general tactic that does the same thing as a number of individual lemmas, we should use the general tactic. An analogy would be `ext`, which could instead be a differently named extensionality lemma for each kind of structure you're dealing with; we prefer the former.",

I would like to see this merged soon, so I can extend this API to `closure` and `continuous` (or perhaps you plan to do so?).",

I would prefer `s ∩ t = s ∩ t` because prefix operators are more common than postfix operators, and I'm seeing `(s ∩ .)` as a prefix operator.\r\n\r\nI had suggested the current meaning of `A ↓∩ B`. Here are the options:\r\n\r\n* Use `A ↓∩ B` to mean \"an intersection down to the subtype for `A`\". I suggested this because I am seeing this as a prefix operator `(A ↓∩ .)` where `A` is configuration for the operator (it sets the type of the result too).\r\n\r\n* Use `B ↓∩ A` to mean \"an intersection with `A` where `B` is pulled down to `A`\". If this notation is like a type-ascription-based-coercion, then it has some parallel with `(. : Set A)` for the inverse operation, assuming that would trigger a coercion (though prefix arrow is also the inverse operation). (This is a matter of taste, but I would find the arrow on the other side to be easier to read, as in `B ∩↓ A`, but again, that's just personal taste.)",

Leave it as it is: a prefix operator, with statements that respect the sides of the intersections. The bad part is that it doesn't match `Subtype.image_preimage_coe`.\r\n2. Change the statement so it matches `Subtype.image_preimage_coe`, as @eric-wieser  suggests. The problem with that option is that we get the weird change of order in the operands in the statement.\r\n3. Change the notation to `B ∩↓ A`. That solves both the inconsistencies with  `Subtype.image_preimage_coe` and the order of operands. The problem here would be it is a postfix operator.\r\n4. Change the definition of `Subtype.image_preimage_coe`. That could be quite messy, since many results in mathlib depend on it.\r\n\r\nMy vote would go to 1 or 3. I personally don't like much 2. and 4. means opening a can of worms that i would rather not deal with.",

One cuestion: why is `constructor` preferable over `apply Iff.intro`?\r\n\r\n`constructor` is a quite general tactic, whereas for the latter, you'd have to name the appropriate structure `Iff.intro`, `And.intro`, which to me feels too low-level, reaching into the implementation details. It's mostly a matter of personal taste, but I think if there's a general tactic that does the same thing as a number of individual lemmas, we should use the general tactic. An analogy would be `ext`, which could instead be a differently named extensionality lemma for each kind of structure you're dealing with; we prefer the former.",
