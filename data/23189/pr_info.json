        "body": "This is one of a series of PRs that generalizes type classes across Mathlib. These are generated using a new linter that tries to re-elaborate theorem definitions with more general type classes to see if it succeeds. It will accept the generalization if deleting the entire type class causes the theorem to fail to compile, and the old type class can not simply be re-synthesized with the new declaration. Otherwise, the generalization is rejected as the type class is not being generalized, but can simply be replaced by implicit type class synthesis or an implicit type class in a variable block being pulled in.\r\n\r\nThe linter currently output debug statements indicating source file positions where type classes should be generalized, and a script then makes those edits. This file contains a subset of those generalizations. The linter and the script performing re-writes is available in commit 5e2b7040be0f73821c1dcb360ffecd61235d87af.\r\n\r\nAlso see discussion on Zulip here:\r\nhttps://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/channel/270676-lean4/topic/Elab.20to.20generalize.20type.20classes.20for.20theorems/near/498862988 https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/channel/287929-mathlib4/topic/Elab.20to.20generalize.20type.20classes.20for.20theorems/near/501288855\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n<!-- The text above the `---` will become the commit message when your\r\nPR is merged.

I think some of these are okay, but there are quite a few that I think are not doing anything useful.\r\n\r\nMoreover, something about this linter makes me skeptical: it only caught declarations with type class arguments provided *explicitly* in the declaration (as opposed to in a `variable` line). This makes me suspect that it *didn't* look for changes to other declarations (or, if it did, it tried to change `variable` blocks which failed because some of the declarations needed the existing variables). In either of these cases, I think we *shouldn't* merge these because it is introducing semi-arbitrary discrepancies in generalization.",
