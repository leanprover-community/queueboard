As `combinatorialGameTheory` is often used to describe game theory problems that involve clear rules and strategic analysis. These problems typically involve finite, deterministic games, such as board games or other strategy games. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, `gameTheory` is more general that encompasses studies involving mechanic design and strategic interactions in fields like economics. As my current plan involves Myerson's Lemma and mechanism design, then using `gameTheory` might be more appropriate.",

It provides a method for designing **incentive compatible** mechanisms that allow participants to maximize their individual interests while also achieving the overall objectives desired by the designer. In doing so, `myersonsLemma` helps address issues of information asymmetry and incentive compatibility, making mechanism design widely applicable in areas such as auctions, public goods provision, and contract design.\r\n\r\nFor more of our plan, we have tried to 'sell' the plan formalised economic-related theorems to economist.

Furthermore, it allows us to develop and refine these formalizations independently, while still enrich mathlib's core libraries. \r\n\r\nWe can always revisit incorporating parts into mathlib later if generally useful abstractions emerge. For now, a repo gives us the freedom to focus on formalizing game theory concepts. I appreciate the suggestions to improve integration with mathlib, but I think the separate repo approach strikes a good balance between mathlib and developing specialized game theory formalizations. \r\n\r\nI think if @Shreyas4991 agree we may contribute the Gametheory repo together.

This theorem, which essentially shows how bidders' mutual influence can drive up prices, is a good example of monotone comparative analysis, an area of particular interest to many theoretical economists.\r\n\r\nRegarding equilibrium refinement, Selten's _trembling hand equilibrium_ is a widely used method for eliminating equilibria in complete information settings. This concept, which earned Selten a Nobel Prize, aims to remove less ‘plausible’ Nash equilibria by considering the stability of equilibria under small mistakes by players. In incomplete information settings, we might look at refining perfect _Bayesian Nash equilibria_ using the incentive compatible condition proposed by Milgrom and Weber.\r\n\r\nUsing Lean for these proofs could be particularly valuable. It could ensure that we don't overlook any possibilities when solving for equilibria and performing equilibrium deletion. This rigorous proof process could also provide insights for designing experiments to validate how these mechanisms operate in practice.\r\n\r\nThe logic behind Myerson's equivalence theorem might follow a similar approach:\r\n\r\n- Identify the equilibrium sets for mechanisms A and B\r\n- Refine these equilibria\r\n- Compare the allocations and revenues at the refined equilibrium points\r\n\r\nFormalizing these processes with Lean could allow us to avoid relying on specific parameter values, potentially leading to more general and convincing results. The challenge lies in clearly describing these problems within Lean's framework.\r\n\r\nThis approach could be particularly powerful for comparing mechanisms. For instance, to show that mechanism A is at least as good as mechanism B, we could use Lean to systematically work through the steps of finding equilibria, refining them, and comparing outcomes. This could provide a more comprehensive and reliable analysis than traditional methods that often rely on specific numerical examples.\r\n\r\nThe main challenge will likely be in translating these game-theoretic concepts and processes into Lean's formal language. However, once accomplished, this could open up new possibilities for automated checking and verification of game-theoretic results.\r\n\r\nTo date, we have contacted two economists in Singapore to help us confirm the applicability and feasibility of our theoretical approach. We are also actively advancing our project with the aim of 'selling' our ideas to a broader group of economists once we have made further progress. This might presents a good opportunity to show to the economics of the potential of formalization methods in economic theory research.",

                    "body": "valuation functions appear in many places in game theory, outside auctions, including voting theory, and fair division theory. It might be useful from a mathlib perspective to factor out valuation functions and the various properties they could have. A more general valuation function would map each participant and some item from a type of items to a real number. Even in auction theory, there are auctions on bundles of items. A general form of auction functions would look like `AgentType → Set (ItemType) → ℝ`. Again take this with a pinch of salt. In mathlib a general definition that can be more widely used is helpful. Further this also belongs in the aforementioned `Basic.lean` file ",

In particular, we definitely don't want to have a differently-named-but-otherwise-identical function for each field that uses it! One solution here is to use notation instead. \n\nAlso note that this is basically the only problem with this PR, so I think it is worth solving this way.",

I see a lot of value in developing this theory and a lot of TCS, econ, physics etc in lean (and this is definitely TCS). However, we are not accustomed to the whole \"generalise as much as possible\" philosophy of math and thus don't have standard battle tested definitions. In a way this works better for us as these abstractions only add a layer of unnecessary and uninsightful jargon. Thus rushing a definition that may or may not be ergonomic into mathlib might result in a suboptimal outcome. \n\n3. As Yury points out, there are likely to be no downstream dependencies of these files outside the folder, and even inside them, some experimentation is going to be needed, and different areas of game theory are going to use different variations of the same conceptual definition.",
