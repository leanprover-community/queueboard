It would be desirable to have `mabel` and implementing it via a `to_additive` tactic seems reasonable to me!\r\n> \r\n> (As mentioned in PR #13233, we currently thought your approach was preferable as it's simpler to maintain; given that there aren't massive short-comings that haven't been identified yet)\r\n> \r\n> However, `to_additive` itself will need improvement, as mentioned below, delaborating the expressions back into terms is probably the wrong approach! Maybe you could ask for help in the [\"metaprogramming/tactics\" stream on Zulip](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/239415-metaprogramming-.2F-tactics) if you want to.\r\n\r\nThank you for the review! I'm so sorry for the time it's taken me to get back to this. I've rewritten the tactics to avoid delaborating the expressions and I've also added tests for the to_additive tactic. All the tests pass except a few concerning error messages for examples that are expected to fail but I'm unsure about how to approach these: they are expected to be of the form \"mabel_nf made no progress\" but the tactic returns \"unresolved goals: ...\"\r\n\r\nI'm also available on GitHub and Zulip to discuss further reviews and I can to rewrite the tactic if I should take a different approach",

I'm so sorry for the time it's taken me to get back to this. I've rewritten the tactics to avoid delaborating the expressions and I've also added tests for the to_additive tactic. All the tests pass except a few concerning error messages for examples that are expected to fail but I'm unsure about how to approach these: they are expected to be of the form \"mabel_nf made no progress\" but the tactic returns \"unresolved goals: ...\"\r\n\r\nI'm also available on GitHub and Zulip to discuss further reviews and I can to rewrite the tactic if I should take a different approach",
