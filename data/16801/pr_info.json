              "body": "My hope for this is to only create 1 more API, rather than 3 (`BoundedFormula, Formula, Sentence`), because juggling between the three of those is possibly the most annoying part of this model theory library.\r\n\r\nThe reason for `BoundedFormula` existing at all is to be able to define quantifiers inductively - these are what you should use if you're dealing syntactically with a particular way of writing a formula, but here I'm hoping to abstract that stuff out. If you want to use quantifiers on the boolean algebra, you still can, through [Formula.iAlls](https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/Mathlib/ModelTheory/Syntax.html#FirstOrder.Language.Formula.iAlls) and such.\r\n\r\nIf we do go for defining the quotient type for bounded formulas, then the first thing we will want is to construct the isomorphism `T.BoundedFormula α n ≃o T.Formula (α ⊕ Fin n)`, showing that the boolean algebras are equivalent.\r\n\r\nStill, I'm willing to be convinced otherwise. @metinersin , do you have a use case in mind where you think `T.BoundedFormula α n` would be better?\r\n",

However, `L.Sentence` is just an abbreviation for `L.Formula Empty` and `L.Formula α` is just an abbreviation for `L.BoundedFormula α 0`. The level of difficulty of proving/defining things using formulas and bounded formulas are identically equal but the former has some technical debt.\r\n\r\nI think the most important use case of this API is being able pass back and forth between formulas/bounded formulas and the quotient type. Any operation on the level of formulas respecting semantic equivalence should also be available on the quotient type, and the routine and easier way to build formulas containing quantifiers is building them from bounded formulas.

              "body": "My hope for this is to only create 1 more API, rather than 3 (`BoundedFormula, Formula, Sentence`), because juggling between the three of those is possibly the most annoying part of this model theory library.\r\n\r\nThe reason for `BoundedFormula` existing at all is to be able to define quantifiers inductively - these are what you should use if you're dealing syntactically with a particular way of writing a formula, but here I'm hoping to abstract that stuff out. If you want to use quantifiers on the boolean algebra, you still can, through [Formula.iAlls](https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/Mathlib/ModelTheory/Syntax.html#FirstOrder.Language.Formula.iAlls) and such.\r\n\r\nIf we do go for defining the quotient type for bounded formulas, then the first thing we will want is to construct the isomorphism `T.BoundedFormula α n ≃o T.Formula (α ⊕ Fin n)`, showing that the boolean algebras are equivalent.\r\n\r\nStill, I'm willing to be convinced otherwise. @metinersin , do you have a use case in mind where you think `T.BoundedFormula α n` would be better?\r\n",

However, `L.Sentence` is just an abbreviation for `L.Formula Empty` and `L.Formula α` is just an abbreviation for `L.BoundedFormula α 0`. The level of difficulty of proving/defining things using formulas and bounded formulas are identically equal but the former has some technical debt.\r\n\r\nI think the most important use case of this API is being able pass back and forth between formulas/bounded formulas and the quotient type. Any operation on the level of formulas respecting semantic equivalence should also be available on the quotient type, and the routine and easier way to build formulas containing quantifiers is building them from bounded formulas.
