It seems very unnatural to me (i.e., the choice to represent sets as indexed families, which are not necessarily even injective!).\n\nWhy not just use actual `Set`s, and just require that there is a `Set.BijOn` function mapping one to the other which is distance preserving on that set?\n\nAs is, you have the strange phenomenon that if you have two different index sets with the same range, then you can't say they are congruent.",

Some evidence was found in that thread that the more general notion (equal pairwise distances) is indeed used in the literature between different metric spaces that don't have an isometric equivalence.\r\n\r\nIn any case, once things move from the general setup in metric spaces to more specific Euclidean applications, the fact that equal distances implies an isometric equivalence in Euclidean spaces with the same finite dimension (or various other such Euclidean cases) will be a natural result to prove early on (that thread has some discussion of how `inner_weightedVSub` / `dist_affineCombination` might be used to prove such results).",

It seems very unnatural to me (i.e., the choice to represent sets as indexed families, which are not necessarily even injective!).\n\nWhy not just use actual `Set`s, and just require that there is a `Set.BijOn` function mapping one to the other which is distance preserving on that set?\n\nAs is, you have the strange phenomenon that if you have two different index sets with the same range, then you can't say they are congruent.",

Some evidence was found in that thread that the more general notion (equal pairwise distances) is indeed used in the literature between different metric spaces that don't have an isometric equivalence.\r\n\r\nIn any case, once things move from the general setup in metric spaces to more specific Euclidean applications, the fact that equal distances implies an isometric equivalence in Euclidean spaces with the same finite dimension (or various other such Euclidean cases) will be a natural result to prove early on (that thread has some discussion of how `inner_weightedVSub` / `dist_affineCombination` might be used to prove such results).",
