What I actually wasn't sure about was whether `NonarchimedeanGroup` implied `TopologicalGroup` – the definition makes perfect sense for a topological space that is also an abstract group; you don't need to assume continuity of the group operations to define it, although it does seem that mathlib has chosen to enforce that G be a topological group nonetheless. (Indeed I suspect that the nonarchimedean property very probably *implies* continuity of the group operations, which would mean two of the arguments to the constructor of `NonarchimedeanGroup` are redundant, but I haven't checked that carefully.)",

As for the name, maybe \"exists_openSubgroup_separating\" is slightly clearer? Since `OpenSubgroup` is already the name of a type in mathlib it shouldn't have an underscore.

Firstly, the use of `simp_rw` seems a bit clumsy: your goal is a big chain of \"and\"s and you are using simp_rw to deal with each of them in turn, so at the end the goal has become `True ∧ True ∧ True ...`. Hence the search-and-replace facility of `simp_rw` isn't being used, and there's a danger of \"leakage\" if the rewrites you use for one goal have some effect on the other. So I'd suggest being honest about the fact that you're dealing with the subgoals in turn.\r\n\r\nThe next natural idea would be to use focussing dots, and a tactic block for each subgoal; but actually every single goal can be made into a one-liner – Lean's dot-notation is a very powerful weapon here. Note also the use of term-mode rewrites, `foo ▸ bar` to mean \"rewrite using foo in bar\".\r\n\r\nFinally, in the last line: function composition associates leftwards by default, (((so all the) brackets) aren't required). `emptyUuv <| ((((h2 u v ou) ov) Uuv) Uu) Uv` is parsed exactly the same as `emptyUuv (h2 u v ou ov Uuv Uu Uv)`.

What I actually wasn't sure about was whether `NonarchimedeanGroup` implied `TopologicalGroup` – the definition makes perfect sense for a topological space that is also an abstract group; you don't need to assume continuity of the group operations to define it, although it does seem that mathlib has chosen to enforce that G be a topological group nonetheless. (Indeed I suspect that the nonarchimedean property very probably *implies* continuity of the group operations, which would mean two of the arguments to the constructor of `NonarchimedeanGroup` are redundant, but I haven't checked that carefully.)",
