              "body": "Thanks for doing this; I agree this policy would be great to have. (In fact, mucking out that folder was on my list of things as well - I'm happy to see you got to it earlier!)\r\n\r\nLet me go through the first scripts individually.\r\nFor one group, I immediately agree that those can be removed. All of them are specific to mathlib and are obsolete now that the port is done. Feel free to cherry-pick those in a separate PR and maintainer merge that on my behalf already.\r\n- align_import generates the `align_import` commands: there is no need to re-generate these as the port is now done -> this seems safe to remove\r\n- align.py: similar (though I'm not 100% sure what this tool does)\r\n- `make_port_status` regenerates mathlib's port-status page: there's no need for that any more; `run_port_status` is similar\r\n- `start_port` is also specific to mathlib -> seems safe to remove\r\n\r\nI'd like to talk about fix-lints, fix-line-breaks and fix-comments more carefully.\r\n- The functionality of `fix-line-breaks` is included in `lint_style.py` now. ~~ --- but the calling script is not adapted, AFAICT.~~ Edited later: this script was only called in `start-port.sh`.\r\n- I am not sure about `fix_lints`. Would or could this be useful to somebody porting their Lean3 project? These still happen occasionally. (If the latter, this script should at least be documented appropriate in the wiki - so people looking for it can still find this without PR archeology.)\r\n- Please don't remove `fix-comments.py` just yet (or let's have a longer discussion first); I think mathlib still has a about a hundred comments referring to mathlib3 names. (I worked on this in the spring, not all of this has landed yet; some was fixed in the mean-time. I partially reinvented that script, before realising it existed...; I would certainly prefer to run it on all of mathlib once to see if it finds anything.\r\n\r\nI have not thought about check_silent.sh or benchmark.sh yet. The former's check does run in CI right now, correct? How is it implemented now? (If that makes the script obsolete, that's fine. Edited later: yes, both are obsolete, see @semorrison's comments.)",
