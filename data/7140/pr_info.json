Arguably, the value in _that_ definition in the first place is that it coincides.\r\n\r\nMaybe it's obvious to you that this generalization is the right one, but in cases where it's not its often best to leave the generalization for someone who does care about it, so that they can ensure the generalization goes in the right directions.\r\n",
