This makes it easier to see for the reviewers what has changed since their last review. So use `git merge` instead of `git rebase`. (In this case it wasn't a big deal, since it was clear what commits you added after my review.)\r\n\r\nNoted, thanks for reminding me. (I generally try to obey this. In this case, I noticed a trivial error in the commit I just pushed; I amended that commit instead of pushing a new \"oops\" commit. Old habits die hard...)",
