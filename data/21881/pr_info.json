              "body": "@adomani @bryangingechen I guess this change is straightforward from an implementation perspective. Would you like to weigh in on the \"do we want to make this change\" side? I'm proposing this to make the metadata updating for the queueboard more reliable: the current mechanism still falls behind (and recovers later, but with a delay) because of this. I'm hoping for this to be the last blocker to switching purely to aggregate metadata, which is both simpler and a pre-requisite for much faster updating of the queueboard webpage in the future. See https://github.com/jcommelin/queueboard/issues/69 for the bigger picture.",

Since it seems I probably won't be able to get to that today either, I guess my main question is this: is it really necessary to use a label to track the CI status? I would have thought that it would be possible to query for PRs where the CI status of the build job is still \"in progress\" vs finished (again, I ask this without having looked at how queueboard works, so I'm probably missing something).\r\n\r\nIf we merge this PR, there is a most likely negligible cost in terms of additional `GITHUB_TOKEN` usage, which I don't think is a problem. However, I'm more concerned about the added complexity of having business logic in other repos that depends on labeling / unlabeling here.",

              "body": "@adomani @bryangingechen I guess this change is straightforward from an implementation perspective. Would you like to weigh in on the \"do we want to make this change\" side? I'm proposing this to make the metadata updating for the queueboard more reliable: the current mechanism still falls behind (and recovers later, but with a delay) because of this. I'm hoping for this to be the last blocker to switching purely to aggregate metadata, which is both simpler and a pre-requisite for much faster updating of the queueboard webpage in the future. See https://github.com/jcommelin/queueboard/issues/69 for the bigger picture.",

Since it seems I probably won't be able to get to that today either, I guess my main question is this: is it really necessary to use a label to track the CI status? I would have thought that it would be possible to query for PRs where the CI status of the build job is still \"in progress\" vs finished (again, I ask this without having looked at how queueboard works, so I'm probably missing something).\r\n\r\nIf we merge this PR, there is a most likely negligible cost in terms of additional `GITHUB_TOKEN` usage, which I don't think is a problem. However, I'm more concerned about the added complexity of having business logic in other repos that depends on labeling / unlabeling here.",
