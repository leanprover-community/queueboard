One can prove the inequality of cardinalities using the real number $ \\|| A \\|| $.\r\n\r\nWhile I was experimenting I wrote the lemma `exists_entry_norm_eq_norm_Matrix` which I think it could be useful in general . If you agree I can make another PR and add the lemma to 'Analysis/Matrix' .

One can prove the inequality of cardinalities using the real number $ \\|| A \\|| $.\r\n\r\nWhile I was experimenting I wrote the lemma `exists_entry_norm_eq_norm_Matrix` which I think it could be useful in general . If you agree I can make another PR and add the lemma to 'Analysis/Matrix' . Otherwise I will just get rid of it.\r\n\r\nIt would be great if you guys @faenuccio and @riccardobrasca could take a look now. Thanks in advance!\r\n",

When you apply a `rw [foo]` to two things you can compact those with `rw [foo] at h1 h2` instead of using two lines.\r\n\r\nBut thanks for the work!",
