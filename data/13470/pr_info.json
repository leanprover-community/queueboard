If you only work with the $\\mathbb{Z}$-valued one, you constantly need to keep track of the positivity assumption, which is automatically dealt with by things like `omega` and `linarith` if all terms are in `Nat`. What @fbarroero is doing, is to go towards diophantine approximation, where you need to mix normed/geometric arguments with arithmetic ones, so I feel that this `natNorm` gadget makes some sense. But both @eric-wieser and @j-loreaux have more experience, so if there are still more objections I will withdraw my suggestion.",

Moreover, `natNorm` is just a bare function, it's not bundled in any way, so you don't get any benefits there.\r\n\r\nAs Eric mentioned, I think if we want something like this, we need to developed an API for distances/norms that take values in other places besides `ℝ`. There was some discussion about this (only visible to Filippo, sorry Fabrizio) regarding another PR, see [here](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/345428-mathlib-reviewers/topic/.2310680.20pseudo.20metrics.20with.20generic.20codomain/near/431317837).\r\n\r\nIn any case, I'm not going to put my foot down here.

If you only work with the $\\mathbb{Z}$-valued one, you constantly need to keep track of the positivity assumption, which is automatically dealt with by things like `omega` and `linarith` if all terms are in `Nat`. What @fbarroero is doing, is to go towards diophantine approximation, where you need to mix normed/geometric arguments with arithmetic ones, so I feel that this `natNorm` gadget makes some sense. But both @eric-wieser and @j-loreaux have more experience, so if there are still more objections I will withdraw my suggestion.",

Moreover, `natNorm` is just a bare function, it's not bundled in any way, so you don't get any benefits there.\r\n\r\nAs Eric mentioned, I think if we want something like this, we need to developed an API for distances/norms that take values in other places besides `ℝ`. There was some discussion about this (only visible to Filippo, sorry Fabrizio) regarding another PR, see [here](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/345428-mathlib-reviewers/topic/.2310680.20pseudo.20metrics.20with.20generic.20codomain/near/431317837).\r\n\r\nIn any case, I'm not going to put my foot down here. If you want to `maintainer merge` this, I think there's relatively little harm that can come from it unless the plan for the future is to develop a significant API around `natNorm`.
