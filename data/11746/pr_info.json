        "body": "We define proper action of a group on a topological space, and we prove that in this case the quotient space is T2. We prove that if a Hausdorff group acts properly on $X$, then $X$ is Hausdorff. We also give equivalent definitions of proper action using ultrafilters and show the transfer of proper action to a closed subgroup.\r\nWe show that if $X \\times X$ is Hausdorff and compactly generated then the action is properly discontinuous if and only if it is continuous in the second variable and proper in the sense defined here. The \"compactly generated\" assumption is to be rephrased with typeclass inference in the future.\r\n\r\nCo-authored-by: @EtienneC30\r\nCo-authored-by: @florestan \r\nCo-authored-by: @ADedecker \r\n\r\n---\r\n<!-- The text above the `---` will become the commit message when your\r\nPR is merged.

Here's my attempt: [Lemma about compactly generated spaces #15066](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/15066).\r\n\r\nYou probably want `X : Type u` and `CompactlyGeneratedSpace.{u, u} X` for your characterisation.

I don't remember how much we talked about it during the week, but here's what it means:\r\n\r\nSince the behaviour of `simp` is determined by the set of lemmas which are tagged `simp`, it can change very often, sometimes due to seemingly unrelated changes. Most of the time these changes make `simp` more powerful, which means that if `simp` used to close the goal, it will probably still be able to do so after the change. This means that using `simp` is perfectly fine *as long as it closes the current goal*. If that is not the case, then `simp` may be able to do more progress by becoming more powerful, which could break the rest of the proof.\r\n\r\nThe typical fix for this is to use `simp?` and use the suggested `simp only`. But in this case all it does is unfold composition, which you can avoid entirely by doing\r\n```suggestion\r\n      ext n\r\n      rw [<-(hs n).2]\r\n      rfl\r\n```\r\nor even\r\n```suggestion\r\n      ext n\r\n      exact (hs n).2.symm\r\n```",

Here this doesn't cause any trouble because there's no definition for `g` and `x`, instead you will just use `hgx1` and `hgx2`. But you'll do yourself a favor by sticking to the \"no `have` for data\" rule.\r\nAlso, it's maybe a bit more idiomatic to use `rcases` here, but `let` is perfectly fine.",
