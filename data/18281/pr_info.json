(Hopefully, only authors of syntax linters need to become aware of this fact.) I agree that this might be slightly unelegant from a theoretical perspective. I like the benefit of checking every file for copyright headers (and that seems fitting as the \"most root\" check of all, given that it - very unlikely has, but theoretically remotely in principle could - have legal implications, unlike any style linter).\r\nThat said, I don't care very strongly about this: if you find this confusing and less helpful, I'm happy to remove this \"pre-root\" file.\r\n\r\nTaking a step back:\r\n- I would like to remove the Python copyright linter. It's just nicer to have infrastructure written in Lean, and as syntax linters.\r\n- Currently, the header linter doesn't cover the imports of Mathlib.Init - so there is a small gap. You were not really happy with the gap (I agree with this).\r\n- Importing the header linter closes the above gap, by making sure the copyright is checked everywhere.\r\n\r\nI am happy to un-import the header linter, but that means a previous concern of yours in addressed less. What do you think which of these options do you prefer?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI *would* like to, however, land this check for importing `Mathlib.Init`. The dependent PRs show this is easy to get wrong; I personally like this solution as it is more lightweight that `init-creation.sh`. (That script was great for creating the Init file! But for checking, a different mechanism suffices.)",

(Hopefully, only authors of syntax linters need to become aware of this fact.) I agree that this might be slightly unelegant from a theoretical perspective. I like the benefit of checking every file for copyright headers (and that seems fitting as the \"most root\" check of all, given that it - very unlikely has, but theoretically remotely in principle could - have legal implications, unlike any style linter).\r\nThat said, I don't care very strongly about this: if you find this confusing and less helpful, I'm happy to remove this \"pre-root\" file.\r\n\r\nTaking a step back:\r\n- I would like to remove the Python copyright linter. It's just nicer to have infrastructure written in Lean, and as syntax linters.\r\n- Currently, the header linter doesn't cover the imports of Mathlib.Init - so there is a small gap. You were not really happy with the gap (I agree with this).\r\n- Importing the header linter closes the above gap, by making sure the copyright is checked everywhere.\r\n\r\nI am happy to un-import the header linter, but that means a previous concern of yours in addressed less. What do you think which of these options do you prefer?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI *would* like to, however, land this check for importing `Mathlib.Init`. The dependent PRs show this is easy to get wrong; I personally like this solution as it is more lightweight that `init-creation.sh`. (That script was great for creating the Init file! But for checking, a different mechanism suffices.)",

That should simplify the script in this PR, right?",
