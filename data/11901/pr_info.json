Because of that, I'm not sure it's worth adding, but it could be a nice shortcut.\r\n\r\nThanks for alerting me to `h.closedEmbedding.locallyCompactSpace`, that was off my radar! I agree that the previous version of the result was probably not worth adding as it was just a rename of that result. I wonder if it's worth adding the revised version however, making use of both directions `h.closedEmbedding` and `h.symm.openEmbedding` to give an if and only if. It might be easier to find for someone looking directly for a homeomorphism result on locally compact spaces. Although I no longer actually need this revised version in my own project as `h.closedEmbedding.locallyCompactSpace` will do, so I'm happy with either decision on whether the revised one is worth adding.",

I agree that the previous version of the result was probably not worth adding as it was just a rename of that result. I wonder if it's worth adding the revised version however, making use of both directions `h.closedEmbedding` and `h.symm.openEmbedding` to give an if and only if. It might be easier to find for someone looking directly for a homeomorphism result on locally compact spaces. Although I no longer actually need this revised version in my own project as `h.closedEmbedding.locallyCompactSpace` will do, so I'm happy with either decision on whether the revised one is worth adding.",
