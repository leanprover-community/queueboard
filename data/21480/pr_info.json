It seems like it would be a little more lenient!\r\n\r\nMy immediate reaction is that while I think it is very common for programs to have both a program-specific envvar and also to then fallback to XDG (see [my giant list here of just programs I use...](https://github.com/Julian/dotfiles/blob/main/.config/zsh/.zshenv)), I don't know of any which have that which perform the check you mention. I'm not saying it's not possible someone doing it is making a mistake, but I guess it feels weird to check for to me for reasons I can't quite articulate -- usually for this sort of thing I think you \"trust\" that someone setting an envvar has double checked and really means to do what they're trying to do (and so it'd be odd to prevent them from doing it in the program if in theory it's possible they mean what they say).\r\n\r\nI'm happy to add it though if you'd like, I don't think anyone really will ever be *negatively* affected by it in practice.",

It seems like it would be a little more lenient!\r\n\r\nMy immediate reaction is that while I think it is very common for programs to have both a program-specific envvar and also to then fallback to XDG (see [my giant list here of just programs I use...](https://github.com/Julian/dotfiles/blob/main/.config/zsh/.zshenv)), I don't know of any which have that which perform the check you mention. I'm not saying it's not possible someone doing it is making a mistake, but I guess it feels weird to check for to me for reasons I can't quite articulate -- usually for this sort of thing I think you \"trust\" that someone setting an envvar has double checked and really means to do what they're trying to do (and so it'd be odd to prevent them from doing it in the program if in theory it's possible they mean what they say).\r\n\r\nI'm happy to add it though if you'd like, I don't think anyone really will ever be *negatively* affected by it in practice.",
