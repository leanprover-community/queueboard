If not, I think you can do much less work (and get a metric structure as a bonus) by endowing `ℕ` with the distance induced by the injection `fun n : ℕ ↦ (2 : ℝ) ^ (-n : ℤ)`. Then the identity is obviously Cauchy, and the topology is discrete because the singleton `{n}` is the preimage of the open set `Ioo ((2 : ℝ) ^ (-n - 1 : ℤ)) ((2 : ℝ) ^ (-n+1 : ℤ))`.",

After your explanation I certainly agree that your example should appear. To my eyes, the best presentation would be\r\n1. The definition of your distance\r\n1. The definition of my uniformity\r\n1. The proof that `(your distance).toUniformity` = `my uniformity`\r\nand somewhere (probably between 1. and 2.) the proof that this induces the discrete topology (whatever proof is shorter).\r\n\r\nThis would certainly require to add your distance in the docstring before my uniformity and to add the proof of the equality. I am desperately out of time now, so I would be very happy if you want to enforce this (if you agree with the plan). But you might be equally out of time, in which case we can let this wait (and hopefully not rotten)...",

Since you have a somewhat clear idea on how you would want it to look like, and I am happy to follow your suggestions, I would prefer to avoid some trial-and-error, just doing stuff and then having to revert it back. Do you find it reasonable if I suggest one of the two following options:\r\n1. We merge it as it is, but adding more doc (and a TODO) mentioning that this construction actually comes from that metric, and saying that it would be nice if in the future someone (some student of mine during a small internship :smirk: ?) re-opens the file and improves it with your suggestion; or\r\n2. You at least propose a sorried skeleton and I start from there.\r\n\r\nThanks for your feedback!",

              "body": "> Do you care about the particular form of the counterexample ? If not, I think you can do much less work (and get a metric structure as a bonus) by endowing `ℕ` with the distance induced by the injection `fun n : ℕ ↦ (2 : ℝ) ^ (-n : ℤ)`. Then the identity is obviously Cauchy, and the topology is discrete because the singleton `{n}` is the preimage of the open set `Ioo ((2 : ℝ) ^ (-n - 1 : ℤ)) ((2 : ℝ) ^ (-n+1 : ℤ))`. \n\nOh nice, this example did not cross my mind! I must say that\n1. I kind of like my counterexample because it has a \"point-set topology\" flavour, without any distance, and I like the idea of playing with uniformities simply as filters. But this can be reversed as in \"I do not like your counterexample due to its point-set topology flavour...\" ;-).\n2. Implementing yours does not seems 100% straightforward: since `ℕ` is not a group, it won't be a (semi)NormedAddGroup. I think that what you have in mind is the distance `dist (x, y) := (2 : ℝ) ^ (- |(x : ℤ) - (y : ℤ)|)) but for which there is very little API, so one would need to prove from first principles that it is a distance, no (like triangle inequality, symmetric, etc...). I am not saying it is \"hard\", just that AFAIU it is not a 10-lines application of things in the library (of course, I am going all-in saying this to you... bear with me).\n3. All in all, I am happy to do whatever you suggest, from just forgetting about this counterexample, to implementing both, to having this one go first and at a second stage implement your example... What's your preference?",

I must say that\n1. I kind of like my counterexample because it has a \"point-set topology\" flavour, without any distance, and I like the idea of playing with uniformities simply as filters. But this can be reversed as in \"I do not like your counterexample due to its point-set topology flavour...\" ;-).\n2. Implementing yours does not seems 100% straightforward: since `ℕ` is not a group, it won't be a (semi)NormedAddGroup. I think that what you have in mind is the distance `dist (x, y) := (2 : ℝ) ^ (- |(x : ℤ) - (y : ℤ)|)) but for which there is very little API, so one would need to prove from first principles that it is a distance, no (like triangle inequality, symmetric, etc...). I am not saying it is \"hard\", just that AFAIU it is not a 10-lines application of things in the library (of course, I am going all-in saying this to you... bear with me).\n3. All in all, I am happy to do whatever you suggest, from just forgetting about this counterexample, to implementing both, to having this one go first and at a second stage implement your example... What's your preference?",

After your explanation I certainly agree that your example should appear. To my eyes, the best presentation would be\r\n1. The definition of your distance\r\n1. The definition of my uniformity\r\n1. The proof that `(your distance).toUniformity` = `my uniformity`\r\nand somewhere (probably between 1. and 2.) the proof that this induces the discrete topology (whatever proof is shorter).\r\n\r\nThis would certainly require to add your distance in the docstring before my uniformity and to add the proof of the equality. I am desperately out of time now, so I would be very happy if you want to enforce this (if you agree with the plan).
