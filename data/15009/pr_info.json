My proof was the one in Stein-Shakarchi's Functional Analysis book. It was very convenient to have 0 and 1 and then I obtained the rest via a transformation, so I just adapted that part to commit here. I haven't really studied the details of how the current mathlib proof actually works. I can try to go through it if it's better to prove the general case first, but I don't think I will have enough time for that in the next couple of weeks.",

My proof was the one in Stein-Shakarchi's Functional Analysis book. It was very convenient to have 0 and 1 and then I obtained the rest via a transformation, so I just adapted that part to commit here. I haven't really studied the details of how the current mathlib proof actually works.
