These naturally induce isomorphisms between finite substructures, so I don't think this is an important difference. I have some more thoughts about this that I could convey better on Zulip.",

These naturally induce isomorphisms between finite substructures, so I don't think this is an important difference. I have some more thoughts about this that I could convey better on Zulip.",
