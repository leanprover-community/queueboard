We've come to a rough consensus that deprecated aliases are cheap and hence should be added by default when renaming.\r\n\r\nCheap, yes – but it is overkill to add a full deprecation alias for a one-character capitalisation mistake by @MichaelStollBayreuth (I admit that neither me or anyone else checked this before the merge). The deprecated name shows up in the docs too, which causes unnecessary duplication.\r\n\r\nIndeed I am against your adding of the deprecation aliases in #11118. They were to code which is very new to mathlib and hence whose probability of being relied on in the meantime was essentially zero.\r\n\r\ntl;dr Unless the declaration was ported from mathlib3 and then renamed or it has seen substantial usage elsewhere, adding deprecation notices upon a rename is like littering the environment.",

We've come to a rough consensus that deprecated aliases are cheap and hence should be added by default when renaming.\r\n\r\nCheap, yes – but it is overkill to add a full deprecation alias for a one-character capitalisation mistake by @MichaelStollBayreuth (I admit that neither me or anyone else checked this before the merge). The deprecated name shows up in the docs too, which causes unnecessary duplication.\r\n\r\nIndeed I am against your adding of the deprecation aliases in #11118. They were to code which is very new to mathlib and hence whose probability of being relied on in the meantime was essentially zero.\r\n\r\ntl;dr Unless the declaration was ported from mathlib3 and then renamed or it has seen substantial usage elsewhere, adding deprecation notices upon a rename is like littering the environment.",
