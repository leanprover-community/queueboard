Concretely, `lake exe cache get MyProject/Basic.lean` assumes that there is a folder `./MyProject/`.\r\n\r\nTODO: Test for projects `requiring` a third-party package!\r\n\r\n## Use case:\r\n\r\nI would like to use `lake exe cache get Game.lean` in NNG and others to automatically only fetch the relevant part of Mathlib.\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- The text above the `---` will become the commit message when your\r\nPR is merged.

I haven't thought yet which approach is better.)\r\n\r\nWith my PR, you could write `lake exe cache miniget` to download the cache for all .lean in the current directory, excluding `.lean`. Adding individual files to that wouldn't be hard.",
