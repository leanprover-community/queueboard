We will need to pay attention to not duplicate everything, since I think it would be nice to have a bundled hom in the case of the full space of modular forms. Do you think that this general version will be used, in contrast to, say, apply the bundled `qexpansion` map to the newform (say) viewed as a \"normal\" modular form?",

So there would be no loss in generality in only defining it for `ModularForm` rather than `ModularFormClass`, but there might be a loss of convenience (one more coercion to keep track of). ",

But I'm too lazy to write the considerable volumes of boilerplate code this would involve. ",

We will need to pay attention to not duplicate everything, since I think it would be nice to have a bundled hom in the case of the full space of modular forms. Do you think that this general version will be used, in contrast to, say, apply the bundled `qexpansion` map to the newform (say) viewed as a \"normal\" modular form?",

So there would be no loss in generality in only defining it for `ModularForm` rather than `ModularFormClass`, but there might be a loss of convenience (one more coercion to keep track of). ",
