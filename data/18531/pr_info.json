        "body": "The original `EllipticCurve` is `WeierstrassCurve` bundled with `Δ' : Rˣ` and a proof that `Δ' = Δ`. This definition makes `Δ'` and `j` computable, but at the expense that some APIs must be duplicated for `EllipticCurve` and `WeierstrassCurve`.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds the typeclass `WeierstrassCurve.IsElliptic` which asserts that `IsUnit W.Δ`, and which is a `Prop`. The old API for elliptic curves are replaced by a `WeierstrassCurve` `W` together with `[W.IsElliptic]`. The caveat is that `Δ'` and `j` becomes noncomputable.\r\n\r\nThe original design of this PR is `WeierstrassCurve.Elliptic` which is `Invertible W.Δ`, and which is a `Type`. By this design `Δ'` and `j` remain computable. But this design makes simpNF linter timeout. So this design is abandoned and replaced by current design.\r\n\r\nAlso rename `J.lean` -> `IsomOfJ.lean` and split `ModelsWithJ.lean`.\r\n\r\n---\r\n<!-- The text above the `---` will become the commit message when your\r\nPR is merged.

Mostly because that's just one `W : WeierstrassCurve` across whole file, and in some sections there are `variable [W.IsElliptic]`. If in the beginning it's required to be `IsElliptic`, then I think it's fine to use `E` instead (e.g. in `J.lean`).",

The original result is in `Weierstrass` so the `ModelsWithJ` is also in `Weierstrass`. But now since we don't have `EllipticCurve` anymore, so I think it's OK to move them to another file.

I feel that `FieldTheory/IsSepClosed` is not too large of a dependency (perhaps comparable to `Algebra/CharP` and `RingTheory/Nilpotent` in `Weierstrass.lean`?). If the issue is the length of the file, then I can understand :P\r\n\r\nBesides `IsSepClosed`, it also depends on `NormalForms`. The length of that file is also a concern, though. Anyways the file name `J.lean` maybe not the best, do you think `IsomOfJEq` or something else is better?\r\n\r\nBy the way, I think split `ModelsWithJ.lean` may indeed be a good idea.

I feel that `FieldTheory/IsSepClosed` is not too large of a dependency (perhaps comparable to `Algebra/CharP` and `RingTheory/Nilpotent` in `Weierstrass.lean`?). If the issue is the length of the file, then I can understand :P\r\n\r\n@jcommelin back to you!",

Mostly because that's just one `W : WeierstrassCurve` across whole file, and in some sections there are `variable [W.IsElliptic]`. If in the beginning it's required to be `IsElliptic`, then I think it's fine to use `E` instead (e.g. in `J.lean`).",

The original result is in `Weierstrass` so the `ModelsWithJ` is also in `Weierstrass`. But now since we don't have `EllipticCurve` anymore, so I think it's OK to move them to another file. Probably a new file `ModelsWithJ.lean` but not `J.lean`.\r\n\r\n",
