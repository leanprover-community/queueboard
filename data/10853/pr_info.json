Define `AnalyticManifold` as a charted space compatible with `analyticGroupoid`. \r\n\r\nIn finite dimensions `AnalyticManifold` is equivalent to `SmoothManifoldWithCorners`, so an alternative option would be to leave this out and prove the necessary correspondence via Osgood's theorem. However, we don't have Osgood's theorem yet, and it's nice to have a version that works arbitrarily.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n[![Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io/from-referrer/)\r\n",

Currently I have these defined at https://github.com/girving/ray/blob/be98efd5d2fb6dad741c905262a93bb9aa6eaf49/Ray/AnalyticManifold/AnalyticManifold.lean#L248 only in the boundaryless case, which means analytic in charts.\r\n\r\nWe’ll need to choose how to extend this to the boundaries.  The natural thing following `analyticGroupoid` is analytic on interior points and smooth at boundary points.  If we think that’s the right definition and do the refactor and make a follow up PR, but I’ll wait for discussion first.\r\n\r\nThere’s some awkwardness in that basic theory if we require only smoothness at boundary points won’t look like normal analytic functions.  In particular, an analytic function at a point is locally analytic, but this wouldn’t be true if `HolomorphicAt` at a boundary point meant smooth there.  So we might want to do define `HolomorphicAt` at boundaries to mean smooth at the boundary and holomorphic at nearby interior points.\r\n\r\nI’ll note that the “smooth at boundary” setup makes analyticGroupoid nontrivially more complex, and I’m not sure what it buys us: I haven’t seen that definition before, and currently analyticGroupoid is unused in mathlib.

I haven't seen it elsewhere in mathematics: it's common to want \"analytic inside, continuous at the boundary\", but smooth I haven't seen (and I think analytic inside, continuous at the boundary is better named something else).\r\n\r\nIf we want to do analytic at the boundary we need some additional definitions, though, since we don't have `AnalyticAtWithin`.  Though that is straightforward to write down: it's just \"has a power series which matches the function within\", or equivalently \"is locally the restriction of an analytic function.  In either case, the definition would be downstream of `AnalyticAt` in a separate file.\r\n\r\nI'd be happy to make that change if people think it's the right thing.",

I wonder how this could get merged best.\r\n\r\nFor instance: this PR is quite large; I think splitting into several parts could speed up the review. The `zero` radius and `constFormalMultilinearSeries_zero]` look good; if you make a PR for those, I'd approve that quickly. Perhaps, the `Analytic/Within` file could also be a separate PR.\r\n\r\nEdited to add: I realised that simply moving the definition of `AnalyticGroupoid` could be another quick PR.\r\nReviewing time is very much super-linear in the PR size, so splitting off easy pieces makes this job easier and usually faster.",

I have a number of comments, but they are all very minor (mostly, about compressing your code slightly). Mostly, you can simply accept the github suggestions; if you prefer, I can also make these tweaks tomorrow.\r\nI like how the proofs about the analytic groupoid became much simpler - partly because of the simpler definition, but also because you golfed the proofs! I found a few more ways to compress your code; should be really quick. (If you prefer, I can also apply these changes myself tomorrow; let me know!)\r\n\r\nCan you update the commit message, please - and make sure to\r\n- mention the change of definition and some words on *why*\r\n- add that you prove the product of analytic manifolds to be analytic?

The natural thing following `analyticGroupoid` is analytic on interior points and smooth at boundary points.  If we think that’s the right definition and do the refactor and make a follow up PR, but I’ll wait for discussion first.\r\n\r\nThere’s some awkwardness in that basic theory if we require only smoothness at boundary points won’t look like normal analytic functions.  In particular, an analytic function at a point is locally analytic, but this wouldn’t be true if `HolomorphicAt` at a boundary point meant smooth there.  So we might want to do define `HolomorphicAt` at boundaries to mean smooth at the boundary and holomorphic at nearby interior points.\r\n\r\nI’ll note that the “smooth at boundary” setup makes analyticGroupoid nontrivially more complex, and I’m not sure what it buys us: I haven’t seen that definition before, and currently analyticGroupoid is unused in mathlib.

I haven't seen it elsewhere in mathematics: it's common to want \"analytic inside, continuous at the boundary\", but smooth I haven't seen (and I think analytic inside, continuous at the boundary is better named something else).\r\n\r\nIf we want to do analytic at the boundary we need some additional definitions, though, since we don't have `AnalyticAtWithin`.  Though that is straightforward to write down: it's just \"has a power series which matches the function within\", or equivalently \"is locally the restriction of an analytic function.  In either case, the definition would be downstream of `AnalyticAt` in a separate file.\r\n\r\nI'd be happy to make that change if people think it's the right thing.",

I wonder how this could get merged best.\r\n\r\nFor instance: this PR is quite large; I think splitting into several parts could speed up the review. The `zero` radius and `constFormalMultilinearSeries_zero]` look good; if you make a PR for those, I'd approve that quickly. Perhaps, the `Analytic/Within` file could also be a separate PR.\r\n\r\nEdited to add: I realised that simply moving the definition of `AnalyticGroupoid` could be another quick PR.\r\nReviewing time is very much super-linear in the PR size, so splitting off easy pieces makes this job easier and usually faster.",

Mostly, you can simply accept the github suggestions; if you prefer, I can also make these tweaks tomorrow.\r\nI like how the proofs about the analytic groupoid became much simpler - partly because of the simpler definition, but also because you golfed the proofs! I found a few more ways to compress your code; should be really quick. (If you prefer, I can also apply these changes myself tomorrow; let me know!)\r\n\r\nCan you update the commit message, please - and make sure to\r\n- mention the change of definition and some words on *why*\r\n- add that you prove the product of analytic manifolds to be analytic?
