Just choose some interior point, and the same argument should work, right? (A new condition on `ModelWithCorners` ensures that interior points are dense, at least in the model space.)\r\n\r\nDoes `extChartAt_image_nhd_mem_nhds_of_boundaryless` require the interior to be open? It looks to me like it may not. (If it does, that's a fine reason to wait until a better theory of interior of a manifold is developed. I'm not convinced yet that's required, though.)",
