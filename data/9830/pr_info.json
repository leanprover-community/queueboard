It was a few phases of looking at the output, moving some things to global `noshake`s, some to local `noshake`s, and accepting the rest, then cleanup and reformatting of the result, then doing a second and third pass to ensure a minimal diff and checking that things still compile.\r\n\r\nThe script is able to produce a passable approximation of this PR, but it works best when there are few changes needed and most of the noshakes are already in place; when you run it cold like this it makes a lot of mistakes (because it missed some dependency it wasn't aware of) and makes more mistakes trying to fix its other mistakes, and this requires manual cleanup.",

Files which are import-only are automatically considered as being in this group, so really the only mathlib file we have in this category is `Mathlib.Mathport.Syntax`.\r\n* `ignoreImport` is for files which should be treated as used when importing into another file. This is when there is some property *of the file itself* which means that downstream users will depend on it without having any direct constant-to-constant dependency. That is, tactics and notation files, and files whose main purpose is to add or declare an attribute.\r\n* `ignore` is for individual imports in individual files. This is used when there is some unusual use of a constant which is compile-time only, like double-backtick names, Qq expressions, `attribute [foo] bar`, as well as check-only commands like `#guard` and `example`.",

Files which are import-only are automatically considered as being in this group, so really the only mathlib file we have in this category is `Mathlib.Mathport.Syntax`.\r\n* `ignoreImport` is for files which should be treated as used when importing into another file. This is when there is some property *of the file itself* which means that downstream users will depend on it without having any direct constant-to-constant dependency. That is, tactics and notation files, and files whose main purpose is to add or declare an attribute.\r\n* `ignore` is for individual imports in individual files. This is used when there is some unusual use of a constant which is compile-time only, like double-backtick names, Qq expressions, `attribute [foo] bar`, as well as check-only commands like `#guard` and `example`.",
