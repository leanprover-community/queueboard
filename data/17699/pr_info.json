Then Newton-Gregory is just the binomial expansion of `((X - 1) + 1) ^ n`.",

Instead of just considering the shift operator `f ↦ f (x + 1) - f x`, you could consider more generally `f ↦ ∑ s, w s • f (x + s)` (inaccurate notation, see my LeanCamCombi file for the precise one) where `w` is a finsupp. Your proofs should still go through mostly unchanged, but will be more applicable as you can now talk about general composition of shift operators. This is useful to eg show the way shift operators reduce the degree of a polynomial (this was the original purpose of my LeanCamCombi file) and @grhkm21 on Xena just mentioned a number theory statement that needs the shift operator `f ↦ f (x + s) - f x`.\r\n\r\n> I actually think your treatment could, conversely, benefit from incorporating some ideas from ours (if you intend to pursue it further at any point in future).\r\n\r\nNo plan for now.

I was looking at the circle method, which I imagine analytic NT projects eventually have to work on, so this is relevant.\r\n\r\nOne specific lemma needed for Hua's result on Waring's problem is [Hua's lemma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hua%27s_lemma), which the proof can be found at Section 1.6 of [these notes](https://www.williamchen-mathematics.info/lnhlmfolder/hlm01.pdf) (extended version of Vaughan's \"HL method\" book). And in there we need forward difference operator $\\Delta_1(\\phi(x); h_1) = \\phi(x + h_1) - \\phi(x)$ (and in fact the iterated difference operator $\\Delta_{j + 1}(\\phi(x); h_1, \\ldots, h_{j + 1})$ but not now), even for general $x, h_1 \\in \\mathbb{R}$. So it'll definitely be nice to have the forward difference operator defined generally to accept $h_1$ as a parameter, which of course can't be defined in terms of $\\Delta_1(\\phi(x); 1)$.\r\n\r\nI was not aware of Yael's results, but if their definition is (1) used *somewhere* (2) a generalisation of the one I gave, then sure, why not.\r\n\r\nDavid, do you mind explaining (apart from lack of time, motivation, etc. I mean purely technical aspects) what would be the disadvantages of defining the operator via Yael's definition?\r\n\r\nAlso, let's keep the scope of the PR small and make sure this work by David**'s student** gets in without much pain, so let's not prove any lemmas from Yael's file (but of course we can take the `discForwardDiff` definition for example)",

I'd be happy to be proved wrong, and if Yael wants to work out this approach then he's welcome to go ahead as far as I'm concerned, but I'm not inclined to invest time in it myself. (Yael is not the only one who is busy.)\r\n\r\nI can certainly see the use-case for (iterated) difference operators with an arbitrary specified \"step size\", which would cover the application to Hua's lemma that @grhkm21 mentioned. I would be happy to add this to the current PR.\r\n\r\n",

Instead of just considering the shift operator `f ↦ f (x + 1) - f x`, you could consider more generally `f ↦ ∑ s, w s • f (x + s)` (inaccurate notation, see my LeanCamCombi file for the precise one) where `w` is a finsupp. Your proofs should still go through mostly unchanged, but will be more applicable as you can now talk about general composition of shift operators. This is useful to eg show the way shift operators reduce the degree of a polynomial (this was the original purpose of my LeanCamCombi file) and @grhkm21 on Xena just mentioned a number theory statement that needs the shift operator `f ↦ f (x + s) - f x`.\r\n\r\n> I actually think your treatment could, conversely, benefit from incorporating some ideas from ours (if you intend to pursue it further at any point in future).\r\n\r\nNo plan for now.

I was looking at the circle method, which I imagine analytic NT projects eventually have to work on, so this is relevant.\r\n\r\nOne specific lemma needed for Hua's result on Waring's problem is [Hua's lemma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hua%27s_lemma), which the proof can be found at Section 1.6 of [these notes](https://www.williamchen-mathematics.info/lnhlmfolder/hlm01.pdf) (extended version of Vaughan's \"HL method\" book). And in there we need forward difference operator $\\Delta_1(\\phi(x); h_1) = \\phi(x + h_1) - \\phi(x)$ (and in fact the iterated difference operator $\\Delta_{j + 1}(\\phi(x); h_1, \\ldots, h_{j + 1})$ but not now), even for general $x, h_1 \\in \\mathbb{R}$. So it'll definitely be nice to have the forward difference operator defined generally to accept $h_1$ as a parameter, which of course can't be defined in terms of $\\Delta_1(\\phi(x); 1)$.\r\n\r\nI was not aware of Yael's results, but if their definition is (1) used *somewhere* (2) a generalisation of the one I gave, then sure, why not.\r\n\r\nDavid, do you mind explaining (apart from lack of time, motivation, etc. I mean purely technical aspects) what would be the disadvantages of defining the operator via Yael's definition?\r\n\r\nAlso, let's keep the scope of the PR small and make sure this work by David**'s student** gets in without much pain, so let's not prove any lemmas from Yael's file (but of course we can take the `discForwardDiff` definition for example)",
