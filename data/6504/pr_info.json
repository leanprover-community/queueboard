Indeed, the construction we give in `finsetBiproductDiagram` is essentially the same as `liftToFinset` from the file you mentioned. But there is a key difference: we use biproducts whereas that file uses coproducts. The two are of course isomorphic, but it's more convenient for us to use biproducts as in later constructions we need to consider them as limits. We could have used `liftToFinset` instead, but then we would have had additional work managing the isomorphism with products when we want to prove left exactness. Because of this, I don't think it would save any work to use `liftToFinset`.",

Indeed, the construction we give in `finsetBiproductDiagram` is essentially the same as `liftToFinset` from the file you mentioned. But there is a key difference: we use biproducts whereas that file uses coproducts. The two are of course isomorphic, but it's more convenient for us to use biproducts as in later constructions we need to consider them as limits. We could have used `liftToFinset` instead, but then we would have had additional work managing the isomorphism with products when we want to prove left exactness. Because of this, I don't think it would save any work to use `liftToFinset`.",
