I did not do that because I saw that the library already contains the theorems `log_nonpos_iff` and `log_nonpos_iff'`, which are completely analogous to what my PR suggests.\r\n\r\nIf you reviewers believe that generalizing the existing `log_pos_iff` and `log_nonpos_iff` is the better choice, then I am absolutely fine with that. Please advise.",

(Right now, that's the first line of your PR description, and the title is different. Mathlib's CI is a bit peculiar about this formatting; I've just corrected it for you.) Thanks!",
