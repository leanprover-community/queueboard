This means\r\n- it won't apply to PRs which are closed (because the PR is superseded, or not suitable for mathlib, or some other reasons) but unmerged\r\n- it does not run on *merged* PRs (these also exist, e.g. mathlib adaptation PRs, or somebody updating their personal fork). I think those PRs could also be nice to handle...\r\n\r\nWhat do you think?\r\nIn any case: can you please document the intended behaviour in the workflow, say with a comment on top? Having merged PRs be \"closed\", not \"merged\", is a mathlib peculiarity: this might not be obvious for the readers of this file.",
