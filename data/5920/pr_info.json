              "body": "For what it's worth, I do not think this is the right approach. I appreciate that the plan is to re-enable reasoning about Bitvec as a vector of bits, but I think prioritising the arithmetic representation in this way is a misguided idea. I have been asked by @ericrbg to give an extension of my thoughts (some of which I expressed further in that Zulip thread).\r\n\r\nFirstly, for context, I've recently been working with Fin(2^w) considered as a bitvector in some work of mine: the key stuff I have extracted out here. https://gist.github.com/linesthatinterlace/4843a288498cc8f258212e864b8b2ff6\r\n\r\nIn particular, being able to easily \"pull out\" one of the bits of Fin(2^(w + 1)) is a really nice feature. Notice I don't use the current Bitvec representation (which I also think is bad): but I do use finFunctionFinEquiv to convert between Fin(2^w) and Fin(w) -> Fin 2. I think on some level any approach which does not use this equivalence is missing a trick, because it already does so much work for you.\r\n\r\nEssentially we have two reasonable definitions of Bitvec w, right? `Fin(w) -> Fin 2` and `Fin(2^w)`. You could also have `Fin(w) -> Bool`, I slightly prefer that for various reasons, but that is much of a muchness.\r\n\r\nThe idea behind this PR is that arithmetic operations on Bitvec w should use the Fin(2^w) representation, because that is much faster/you are using native Nat addition. I 100% agree with this.\r\n\r\nHowever, bitwise operations, or bit-manipulation operations - such as complement, or and - should not be done, as here, by converting to the underlying nat values, and *then* doing the bitwise operations on Nat to find the bitwise-and (which is effectively I think what is happening). Because this loses the fact that the numbers have exactly w bits - bitwise-and for Nat is for nats where we don't specify an underlying bitlength, whereas here by definition we do know this. So I cannot believe that the approach here is the correct one. *Clearly* Fin w -> Fin 2 is the better representation here (or, actually, Fin w -> Bool: again, I like this more, but that's a different issue). You also want to be able to do things like \"pull out a bit from the bitwise operation, and tweak that bit based on the number that remains\" (this is what I need to do in my work). If you want to do this over Fin(2^w), really you are going to have to convert to Fin w -> Fin 2 first.\r\n\r\nEssentially you have two types: \"Bitvec w as an arithmetic animal\" and \"Bitvec w as a vector animal\". Both of these have a set of operations and a representation that makes them more efficient. Actually, they also both have an order (former the arithmetic order, the latter the lexographic order), and these orders are compatible. That's sort of I think the whole ballgame.\r\n\r\nThe current approach for Bitvec prioritises the vector approach at the cost of the arithmetic approach (albeit also doing the vector approach in a bad way - tuples are preferable I think). This PR would prioritise the arithmetic approach, but I think the choices it makes with reference to bits are bad, even with the caveat that future PRs are intended to bridge the gap: at the heart the approach ignores the advantages that fixed-width bitwise or bit-twiddling operations give you. I do not think it is the right way to go.\r\n\r\nOne possibility would be that you have Bitvec w (Fin w -> Fin 2 or Fin w -> Bool) and FixedWidth w (Fin (2^w)), with the obvious equivalence between them, and define the operations that are natural on each of them in the sensible way, and the operations that aren't natural (e.g. addition on Bitvec w) you define via conjugation by the equivalence. But you can then also show that this is equivalent to the things that ought to be true about it, if you like. And if you really wanted to be neutral you could have a third type which contained both the BitVec and FixedWidth representations of a number and a proof that they were equivalent, and simply do the required operations on that.\r\n\r\nAnyway: these are just my thoughts as I was alerted to this by @ericrbg: but speaking as someone who has been working with the bit-representation of Fin(2^w) recently, I think this PR completely ignores things like `finFunctionFinEquiv` and is worse for it, and I do not believe it is the right approach.",

For example, sometimes one might have something of type Fin (1 + 1) -> Bool, and you want to treat this as (what I will synonymise as) Fin 2 -> Bool. Actually Lean can do this with no effort, it can unify the types because 1 + 1 is defeq to 2, but if everything is written explictly it can have issues.\r\n\r\n(There are similar issues with Fin (2^0) and Fin 1, incidentally, and Fin (2^1) and Fin 2.

Then, I would like to prove theorems like\r\n```lean\r\ntheorem complement_asVector : (~~~x) = (ofVector <| Vector.map not x.asVector)\r\n```\r\nThis way, we can have both the fast computational behaviour of bitwise and on `Nat`s, plus the easier reasoning of the vector-like perspective. \r\n\r\n",

In light of this, there are some operations that clearly have a much nicer definition in terms of naturals (such as addition and multiplication). On the other hand, it's not clear that defining bitwise operations such as and/or is nicer this way (in fact, it probably isn't but it's still faster :)). My position is to define all of the fundamental operations in terms of underlying naturals for efficiency. And a ```BitVec.bitwise``` could be used for less fundamental operations I suppose.\r\n\r\nThen with these definitions, we will prove that they are equivalent to the corresponding vector-like definitions (in future PRs). It looks like ```finFunctionFinEquiv``` would be useful here (I was unaware of this so thanks for bringing this up). I think just having a function ```BitVec n -> Fin n -> Bool``` is cleaner than a named type and with this we could prove theorems like:\r\n```theorem bitwise_add_eq_add (x y : Nat) : bitwise_add x y i = (x + y) % 2 ^ i``` as done [here](https://github.com/mhk119/lean-smt/blob/a7472ca80c0e34b8722115fc5ca9ebe8a035c11c/Smt/Data/Bitwise.lean#L206) using just properties of natural numbers and ```testBit```.",

Actually I believe we should definitely have a function both ways, i.e. we should define an equiv (which will probably just be finFunctionFinEquiv in a hat): it'll just be a lot easier to work with because sometimes you'll want to pass into the one representation and pass out again (see my getBitResiduum above for an example of what I mean - actually there probably are more performant ways of doing the kind of twiddle I do there but I'm not sure I know how to prove they work...)\r\n\r\nWhat I want to make sure we're doing is that everything lies flat and we don't end up proving the same thing twice separately, or have parallel theories that don't quite work.

In my experience, tiny choices with regards to things like \"how does this actually get bits\" can make a big difference.\r\n\r\nIf you really think this is the best way, however, and we've done the analysis to prove it, then there's no reason not to use this approach.",

This PR stemmed from our project [lean-smt](https://github.com/mhk119/lean-smt/blob/bitvec/Smt/Data/BitVec.lean) where we are working on a Lean tactic that can call an smt-solver to close goals. Really exciting!",

This was mainly because our proofs of bit-blasting theorems all follow this strong induction format where we descend to smaller binary representations (removing elements is painful to do with lists).\r\n\r\nAlso, I'm trying to prove `testBit_ofBits` with this new definition (which was a simple 5-line strong inductive proof before) but I can't seem to generalize over `i` anymore. Issues like this make me favor the `Nat` definition over the `Fin` definition (dependent types are harder to work with). Perhaps, I'm missing something?",

              "body": "For what it's worth, I do not think this is the right approach. I appreciate that the plan is to re-enable reasoning about Bitvec as a vector of bits, but I think prioritising the arithmetic representation in this way is a misguided idea. I have been asked by @ericrbg to give an extension of my thoughts (some of which I expressed further in that Zulip thread).\r\n\r\nFirstly, for context, I've recently been working with Fin(2^w) considered as a bitvector in some work of mine: the key stuff I have extracted out here. https://gist.github.com/linesthatinterlace/4843a288498cc8f258212e864b8b2ff6\r\n\r\nIn particular, being able to easily \"pull out\" one of the bits of Fin(2^(w + 1)) is a really nice feature. Notice I don't use the current Bitvec representation (which I also think is bad): but I do use finFunctionFinEquiv to convert between Fin(2^w) and Fin(w) -> Fin 2. I think on some level any approach which does not use this equivalence is missing a trick, because it already does so much work for you.\r\n\r\nEssentially we have two reasonable definitions of Bitvec w, right? `Fin(w) -> Fin 2` and `Fin(2^w)`. You could also have `Fin(w) -> Bool`, I slightly prefer that for various reasons, but that is much of a muchness.\r\n\r\nThe idea behind this PR is that arithmetic operations on Bitvec w should use the Fin(2^w) representation, because that is much faster/you are using native Nat addition. I 100% agree with this.\r\n\r\nHowever, bitwise operations, or bit-manipulation operations - such as complement, or and - should not be done, as here, by converting to the underlying nat values, and *then* doing the bitwise operations on Nat to find the bitwise-and (which is effectively I think what is happening). Because this loses the fact that the numbers have exactly w bits - bitwise-and for Nat is for nats where we don't specify an underlying bitlength, whereas here by definition we do know this. So I cannot believe that the approach here is the correct one. *Clearly* Fin w -> Fin 2 is the better representation here (or, actually, Fin w -> Bool: again, I like this more, but that's a different issue). You also want to be able to do things like \"pull out a bit from the bitwise operation, and tweak that bit based on the number that remains\" (this is what I need to do in my work). If you want to do this over Fin(2^w), really you are going to have to convert to Fin w -> Fin 2 first.\r\n\r\nEssentially you have two types: \"Bitvec w as an arithmetic animal\" and \"Bitvec w as a vector animal\". Both of these have a set of operations and a representation that makes them more efficient. Actually, they also both have an order (former the arithmetic order, the latter the lexographic order), and these orders are compatible. That's sort of I think the whole ballgame.\r\n\r\nThe current approach for Bitvec prioritises the vector approach at the cost of the arithmetic approach (albeit also doing the vector approach in a bad way - tuples are preferable I think). This PR would prioritise the arithmetic approach, but I think the choices it makes with reference to bits are bad, even with the caveat that future PRs are intended to bridge the gap: at the heart the approach ignores the advantages that fixed-width bitwise or bit-twiddling operations give you. I do not think it is the right way to go.\r\n\r\nOne possibility would be that you have Bitvec w (Fin w -> Fin 2 or Fin w -> Bool) and FixedWidth w (Fin (2^w)), with the obvious equivalence between them, and define the operations that are natural on each of them in the sensible way, and the operations that aren't natural (e.g. addition on Bitvec w) you define via conjugation by the equivalence. But you can then also show that this is equivalent to the things that ought to be true about it, if you like. And if you really wanted to be neutral you could have a third type which contained both the BitVec and FixedWidth representations of a number and a proof that they were equivalent, and simply do the required operations on that.\r\n\r\nAnyway: these are just my thoughts as I was alerted to this by @ericrbg: but speaking as someone who has been working with the bit-representation of Fin(2^w) recently, I think this PR completely ignores things like `finFunctionFinEquiv` and is worse for it, and I do not believe it is the right approach.",

It is probably a faster way to get the definition of `and` and `or` etc. on Bitvectors, but very quickly we will want a generic bitwise on Bitvector, and this cannot depend on `Nat.bitwise` because that definition is wrong when `f false false = true`. So I think all bitwise stuff should probably depend on a generic `bitwise` on bitvectors.\r\n\r\nI disagree with the proposal for two named types, I think we want one `Bitvector`, but definitely we want functions `Bitvec n -> Fin n -> Bool` and `Bitvec n -> Vector n Bool`, but we shouldn't have any type alias for these. I would keep the `Fin (2 ^ n)` representation, but have enough API that the user can induct on it like a vector or use it like a function to bool if they want.",

For example, sometimes one might have something of type Fin (1 + 1) -> Bool, and you want to treat this as (what I will synonymise as) Fin 2 -> Bool. Actually Lean can do this with no effort, it can unify the types because 1 + 1 is defeq to 2, but if everything is written explictly it can have issues.\r\n\r\n(There are similar issues with Fin (2^0) and Fin 1, incidentally, and Fin (2^1) and Fin 2. It's another reason why having a type synonym there can be useful.)\r\n\r\nIt may be that there's better ways to solve this type of issue but I have noticed that sometimes giving a name to a complicated type involving Fin (expression) helps with type unification.",

              "body": "> I agree with @linesthatinterlace that the dependence on Nat.bitwise is bad, mainly for the reason that Nat.bitwise is wrong whenever f false false = true. It is probably a faster way to get the definition of and and or etc. on Bitvectors, but very quickly we will want a generic bitwise on Bitvector, and this cannot depend on Nat.bitwise because that definition is wrong when f false false = true. So I think all bitwise stuff should probably depend on a generic bitwise on bitvectors.\r\n\r\nAlthough I agree `Nat.bitwise` is a bit of a footgun because of the mentioned reasons, I don't really agree with the conclusion. We aren't so much choosing to depend on `Nat.bitwise` as re-using bitwise operations on `Nat`, which happen to be modeled in terms of `Nat.bitwise`. Just like for arithmetic, doing this gives us bitwise `and`/`or`/`not` in a single instruction (assuming `n <= 64`).\r\n\r\nI don't agree that the difference between `Fin 2^n` and `Fin n -> Bool`/`Vector Bool n` lies in arithmetic versus bitwise perspectives. In my opinion this is about whether you want optimized operations (both arithmetic *and* bitwise), or whether you want easy to reason about operations.\r\n\r\nIf we define a `BitVec.bitwise`, I wholeheartedly agree we should stay away from `Nat.bitwise`. I just don't think we should use this `BitVec.bitwise` to define bitwise `and` (and co.) --- we should just prove a theorem allowing us to rewrite `and` in terms of `BitVec.bitwise` for reasoning.\r\n\r\n> I see what you're saying, Chris: I actually think we want equivalences rather than functions but same difference. I don't wholly disagree (though if we only have one type synonym, I think we should called Fin(2^m) FixedWidth and NOT Bitvector: I don't think we should call something Bitvector when it isn't vectorish in shape).\r\n\r\nDefining these equivalences has been the plan since day 1 (or at least, my plan), and what I meant by \"Subsequent PRs will prove equivalence lemmas between the Nat-based operations and their naive bit-by-bit versions, to re-enable reasoning about Bitvecs as just \"a vector of bits\".\" in an earlier comment of mine.\r\nThe consensus before was that this PR was already too big and difficult to review, so it was not considered desirable to include those equivalences right away.\r\nInstead, we want to agree on the fundamental basic representation first, and prove the obvious equivalences later.\r\n\r\nWhat I have in mind there is to define the equivalence in terms of `toVector : BitVec n -> Vector Bool n` (`Vector` used for illustration, `Fin n -> Bool` could of course also work) and `ofVector : Vector Bool n -> BitVec n`. Then, I would like to prove theorems like\r\n```lean\r\ntheorem complement_asVector : (~~~x) = (ofVector <| Vector.map not x.asVector)\r\n```\r\nThis way, we can have both the fast computational behaviour of bitwise and on `Nat`s, plus the easier reasoning of the vector-like perspective. \r\n\r\n",

              "body": "Thanks @linesthatinterlace for your comment. Right, the idea is to define Bitvector operations in terms of operations on underlying natural numbers because it is much faster. In light of this, there are some operations that clearly have a much nicer definition in terms of naturals (such as addition and multiplication). On the other hand, it's not clear that defining bitwise operations such as and/or is nicer this way (in fact, it probably isn't but it's still faster :)). My position is to define all of the fundamental operations in terms of underlying naturals for efficiency. And a ```BitVec.bitwise``` could be used for less fundamental operations I suppose.\r\n\r\nThen with these definitions, we will prove that they are equivalent to the corresponding vector-like definitions (in future PRs). It looks like ```finFunctionFinEquiv``` would be useful here (I was unaware of this so thanks for bringing this up). I think just having a function ```BitVec n -> Fin n -> Bool``` is cleaner than a named type and with this we could prove theorems like:\r\n```theorem bitwise_add_eq_add (x y : Nat) : bitwise_add x y i = (x + y) % 2 ^ i``` as done [here](https://github.com/mhk119/lean-smt/blob/a7472ca80c0e34b8722115fc5ca9ebe8a035c11c/Smt/Data/Bitwise.lean#L206) using just properties of natural numbers and ```testBit```.",

              "body": "I think you've persuaded me that this is the right approach. I am a bit surprised that, e.g., finding the complement by calculating 0 - (x+ 1) is the performant way of doing it, but if it is, it is. It would be good to see metrics on this: if we are going to have a Bitwise type that prioritises performance in all things, let's make sure we definitely are making the performant choices.\r\n\r\nAgree that we can then simply have a function to Fin n -> Bool. Actually I believe we should definitely have a function both ways, i.e. we should define an equiv (which will probably just be finFunctionFinEquiv in a hat): it'll just be a lot easier to work with because sometimes you'll want to pass into the one representation and pass out again (see my getBitResiduum above for an example of what I mean - actually there probably are more performant ways of doing the kind of twiddle I do there but I'm not sure I know how to prove they work...)\r\n\r\nWhat I want to make sure we're doing is that everything lies flat and we don't end up proving the same thing twice separately, or have parallel theories that don't quite work. The current PR does still \"tastes messy\" to me in this sense. In my experience, tiny choices with regards to things like \"how does this actually get bits\" can make a big difference.\r\n\r\nIf you really think this is the best way, however, and we've done the analysis to prove it, then there's no reason not to use this approach.",

This means a rather big part of this PR has been removed (since it was upstreamed in Std).\r\n\r\nI've also made some additional changes:\r\n* Define `uge`/`ugt` to complete the matrix of inequalities, while also generalizing the inequalities to work for `BitVec w` rather than `BitVec (w+1)`\r\n* Added the appropriate `#align`s\r\n* Added more simp-lemmas to rewrite bitvector operations into notation, also renamed the existing simp-lemmas to be `foo_eq` rather than `foo_def` (following the example of `Nat.add_eq`)\r\n* Renamed the `to_BV` function to `ofList`\r\n* Removed the `GetElem` instance. Following the discussion in the Std PR, we might not want to commit to a specific ordering, so its better to have users call `getLsb` or `getMsb` explicitly.",
