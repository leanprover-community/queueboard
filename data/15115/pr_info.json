I had apparently completely forgotten to clean up this part of the refactor which finally obtained the requested generalization. (The only defensible bit in the code is that the variable name `oops` was for the final observation to reach a contradiction, so I actually view the variable name here as descriptive, and would prefer to keep unless style strictly prohibits it.)\r\n\r\nThe code was in a terrible shape and not ready for review, indeed --- apologies again. I will clean it up!",

I had apparently completely forgotten to clean up this part of the refactor which finally obtained the requested generalization. (The only defensible bit in the code is that the variable name `oops` was for the final observation to reach a contradiction, so I actually view the variable name here as descriptive, and would prefer to keep unless style strictly prohibits it.)\r\n\r\nThe code was in a terrible shape and not ready for review, indeed --- apologies again.
