Of course, the actual practical definition of Clone doesn't `extend Operad` because that would be very cumbersome and impractical to use.\r\n\r\nAt this point I'm thinking that I should just separate out the Clone part of this PR and just PR that, and leave someone else with more category theory background to define (colored, non-colored, symmetric...) operads.",

And I think my main takeaway at this point is that I'm too much of a non-expert to be adding operads to Mathlib :) and it would be better left to someone else. Really I just wanted to get Clone's in, and (in my limited scope of knowledge and experience) clones extend operads, so I wanted to have those in there first (in the same way that, say, rings extend goups, so you want a definition of group first). Of course, the actual practical definition of Clone doesn't `extend Operad` because that would be very cumbersome and impractical to use.\r\n\r\nAt this point I'm thinking that I should just separate out the Clone part of this PR and just PR that, and leave someone else with more category theory background to define (colored, non-colored, symmetric...) operads.",
