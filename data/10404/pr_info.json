So the original polynomial is a power of the irreducible factor, which has the form X^q^n-a.\r\n\r\nI was not aware of this approach!

In this case the polynomial ring itself is a PID, so I think the finiteness of the multiplicity should comes from the general results of multiplicity being finite for PIDs (or perhaps UFDs, or even [WfDvdMonoid](https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/Mathlib/RingTheory/UniqueFactorizationDomain.html#WfDvdMonoid)).

As for the original result I suggested, it might be more direct to reuse [Irreducible.natSepDegree_eq_one_iff_of_monic](https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/Mathlib/FieldTheory/SeparableDegree.html#Irreducible.natSepDegree_eq_one_iff_of_monic). Just extract a maximum power of an irreducible factor of the polynomial using [UniqueFactorizationMonoid.max_power_factor](https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/Mathlib/RingTheory/UniqueFactorizationDomain.html#UniqueFactorizationMonoid.max_power_factor) (note: many unncessary hypotheses), and what's left is coprime to the irreducible factor by [Irreducible.coprime_or_dvd](https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/Mathlib/RingTheory/PrincipalIdealDomain.html#Irreducible.coprime_or_dvd), so it can't share any common root with the irreducible factor (in any extension), and therefore must be constant (1 if monic) if the original polynomial has only one root. So the original polynomial is a power of the irreducible factor, which has the form X^q^n-a.",

As for the original result I suggested, it might be more direct to reuse [Irreducible.natSepDegree_eq_one_iff_of_monic](https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/Mathlib/FieldTheory/SeparableDegree.html#Irreducible.natSepDegree_eq_one_iff_of_monic). Just extract a maximum power of an irreducible factor of the polynomial using [UniqueFactorizationMonoid.max_power_factor](https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/Mathlib/RingTheory/UniqueFactorizationDomain.html#UniqueFactorizationMonoid.max_power_factor) (note: many unncessary hypotheses), and what's left is coprime to the irreducible factor by [Irreducible.coprime_or_dvd](https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/Mathlib/RingTheory/PrincipalIdealDomain.html#Irreducible.coprime_or_dvd), so it can't share any common root with the irreducible factor (in any extension), and therefore must be constant (1 if monic) if the original polynomial has only one root. So the original polynomial is a power of the irreducible factor, which has the form X^q^n-a.",

Seems that using [multiplicity](https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/Mathlib/RingTheory/Multiplicity.html#multiplicity) is better?\r\n\r\nThat can work but is probably less convenient. I'm not sure in what generality you can show a polynomial have finite multiplicity in another, but at least a monic polynomial of positive degree has finite multiplicity in any nonzero polynomial.\r\n\r\n> By the way, UniqueFactorizationMonoid.max_power_factor requires the (base) ring to be NormalizationMonoid, which I think that a field should be a NormalizationMonoid. But currently mathlib has no instance for this yet.\r\n\r\nI think you need the polynomial ring to be a NormalizationMonoid, not the base ring, which you can get using Classical.arbitrary, because there's [instNonemptyNormalizedGCDMonoid_1](https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/Mathlib/RingTheory/UniqueFactorizationDomain.html#instNonemptyNormalizedGCDMonoid_1) I just added.
