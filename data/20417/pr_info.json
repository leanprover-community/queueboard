        "body": "Prove that the functor `AddCommGrp.ulift` preserves all colimits, hence creates small colimits. (This also finished the proof that it is an exact functor.)\r\n\r\nMethod: Suppose that we have a functor `K : J ⥤ AddCommGrp.{u}` (with `J` any category), a\r\ncolimit cocone `c` of `K` and a cocone `lc` of `K ⋙ uliftFunctor.{u v}`. We want to\r\nconstruct a morphism of cocones `uliftFunctor.mapCocone c → lc` witnessing the fact\r\nthat `uliftFunctor.mapCocone c` is also a colimit cocone, but we have no direct way\r\nto do this. The idea is to use that `AddCommGrp.{max v u}` has a small cogenerator,\r\nwhich is just the additive (rational) circle `ℚ / ℤ`, so any abelian group of\r\nany size can be recovered from its morphisms into `ℚ / ℤ`. More precisely, the functor\r\nsending an abelian group `A` to its dual `A →+ ℚ / ℤ` is fully faithful, *if* we consider\r\nthe dual as a (right) module over the endomorphism ring of `ℚ / ℤ`. So an abelian\r\ngroup `C` is totally determined by the restriction of the coyoneda\r\nfunctor `A ↦ (C →+ A)` to the category of abelian groups at a smaller universe level.\r\nWe do not develop this totally here but do a direct construction. Every time we have\r\na morphism from `lc.pt` into `ℚ / ℤ`, or more generally into any small abelian group\r\n`A`, we can construct a cocone of `K ⋙ uliftFunctor` by sticking `ULift A` at the\r\ncocone point (this is `CategoryTheory.Limits.Cocone.extensions`), and this cocone is\r\nactually made up of `u`-small abelian groups, hence gives a cocone of `K`. Using\r\nthe universal property of `c`, we get a morphism `c.pt →+ A`. So we have constructed\r\na map `(lc.pt →+ A) → (c.pt →+ A)`, and it is easy to prove that it is compatible with\r\npostcomposition of morphisms of small abelian groups. To actually get the\r\nmorphism `c.pt →+ lc.pt`, we apply this to the canonical embedding of `lc.pt` into\r\n`Π (_ : lc.pt →+ ℚ / ℤ), ℚ / ℤ` (this group is not small but is a product of small\r\ngroups, so our construction extends). To show that the image of `c.pt` in this product\r\nis contained in that of `lc.pt`, we use the compatibility with postcomposition and the\r\nfact that we can detect elements of the image just by applying morphisms from\r\n`Π (_ : lc.pt →+ ℚ / ℤ), ℚ / ℤ` to `ℚ / ℤ`.\r\n\r\n- [x] depends on: #20416\r\n- [x] depends on: #20512\r\n- [x] depends on: #20522\r\n\r\n---\r\n<!-- The text above the `---` will become the commit message when your\r\nPR is merged.

In the case of colimits of types, with Markus Himmel, we had used a kind of similar argument, where `ℚ/ℤ` was replaced by the type with two elements `Bool` (see https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/Mathlib/CategoryTheory/Limits/Types.html#CategoryTheory.Limits.Types.isColimit_iff_bijective_desc).\r\n\r\nIt would be great if you could refactor the file `Algebra.Category.Grp.Colimits` where the colimit of `F : J ⥤ Ab` is constructed, by generalizing the definition of `ColimitType F` to the case `J : Type u`, `[Category.{v} J]`, and `F : J ⥤ Ab.{w}` (or whichever permutation of the universes names your prefer), and show there the basic result that if `ColimitType F` is `w`-small, then we have a colimit in `Ab.{w}`. Then, maybe in a separate file so as to reduce imports, you could obtain a statement like `isColimit_iff_bijective_desc` for abelian groups instead of types. For the reverse implication, if `c : Cocone F` is a colimit cocone, we have a canonical (heterogeneous universe) additive map `desc : ColimitType F →+ c.pt`, and by both universal properties, it induces a bijection after the application of the \"functor\" `? →+ A` for any `A : Ab.{w}`, and by using `A := ℚ/ℤ` as you do, we get that `desc` is a bijection. It would follow a `hasColimit_iff_small_colimitType` lemma, and the preservation of colimits by `uliftFunctor` could be deduced. With this structure, I believe your result would integrate more with mathlib.\r\n",

In the case of colimits of types, with Markus Himmel, we had used a kind of similar argument, where `ℚ/ℤ` was replaced by the type with two elements `Bool` (see https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/Mathlib/CategoryTheory/Limits/Types.html#CategoryTheory.Limits.Types.isColimit_iff_bijective_desc).\r\n> \r\n> It would be great if you could refactor the file `Algebra.Category.Grp.Colimits` where the colimit of `F : J ⥤ Ab` is constructed, by generalizing the definition of `ColimitType F` to the case `J : Type u`, `[Category.{v} J]`, and `F : J ⥤ Ab.{w}` (or whichever permutation of the universes names your prefer), and show there the basic result that if `ColimitType F` is `w`-small, then we have a colimit in `Ab.{w}`. Then, maybe in a separate file so as to reduce imports, you could obtain a statement like `isColimit_iff_bijective_desc` for abelian groups instead of types. For the reverse implication, if `c : Cocone F` is a colimit cocone, we have a canonical (heterogeneous universe) additive map `desc : ColimitType F →+ c.pt`, and by both universal properties, it induces a bijection after the application of the \"functor\" `? →+ A` for any `A : Ab.{w}`, and by using `A := ℚ/ℤ` as you do, we get that `desc` is a bijection. It would follow a `hasColimit_iff_small_colimitType` lemma, and the preservation of colimits by `uliftFunctor` could be deduced. With this structure, I believe your result would integrate more with mathlib.\r\n\r\n#20474 for the first step.",
