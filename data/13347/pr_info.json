One can argue that \"simple things\" are goal states you are happy with, and \"hard ones\" are goal states you are unhappy with. If the above lemma is typically used to transform the RHS into a value of the cosZeta function, that it shuold be changed, but if it is meant to unwind coZeta(2k) than this is the right direction (same idea as for simp).
