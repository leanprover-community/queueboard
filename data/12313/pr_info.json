              "body": "Very nice work, thanks a lot!\r\n\r\nI think it would be nice to split up some useful lemmas from the main proof, e.g a version of [Filter.Tendsto.zero_mul_isBoundedUnder_le](https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/Mathlib/Analysis/Normed/Field/Basic.html#Filter.Tendsto.zero_mul_isBoundedUnder_le) where the \"IsBoundedUnder\" hypothesis is replaced by \"being disjoint from `cocompact`\". Then I would deduce a lemma saying that multiplication tends to zero along the infimum of `coprod (𝓝 0) (𝓝 0)` and any filter on the product which is disjoint from `cocompact`. And finally deduce your current result. \r\n\r\nDoes that make sense to you? The reason I'm suggesting this is because I think at least the first intermediate lemma will be useful, and probably the second as well (although I'm less sure).",

              "body": "Very nice work, thanks a lot!\r\n\r\nI think it would be nice to split up some useful lemmas from the main proof, e.g a version of [Filter.Tendsto.zero_mul_isBoundedUnder_le](https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/Mathlib/Analysis/Normed/Field/Basic.html#Filter.Tendsto.zero_mul_isBoundedUnder_le) where the \"IsBoundedUnder\" hypothesis is replaced by \"being disjoint from `cocompact`\". Then I would deduce a lemma saying that multiplication tends to zero along the infimum of `coprod (𝓝 0) (𝓝 0)` and any filter on the product which is disjoint from `cocompact`. And finally deduce your current result. \r\n\r\nDoes that make sense to you? The reason I'm suggesting this is because I think at least the first intermediate lemma will be useful, and probably the second as well (although I'm less sure).",
