Being able to say some foohom is injective can be very helpful for other lemmas that require that as an explicit hypothesis.\n\nThe original impetus for the lemmas were from FLT where one lifts the subtype valuationsubring hom into matrices, and needs the injectivity to show two subfoos end up being the same.\n\nIf the various foohoms were tagged with `@[simps]` then the apply lemma would be autogenerated, but I doubt that all the foohom types here have simps projections defined. Some of the foohoms already had both the apply and coe lemmas defined, but not all of them. So I would leave all these lemmas in place for consistency and completeness, if you're okay with that.",

              "body": "One reason to have the apply lemmas is to be able to rewrite and rewrite backwards, especially in the context of when there are various subfoos or foohoms going on. Being able to say some foohom is injective can be very helpful for other lemmas that require that as an explicit hypothesis.\n\nThe original impetus for the lemmas were from FLT where one lifts the subtype valuationsubring hom into matrices, and needs the injectivity to show two subfoos end up being the same.\n\nIf the various foohoms were tagged with `@[simps]` then the apply lemma would be autogenerated, but I doubt that all the foohom types here have simps projections defined. Some of the foohoms already had both the apply and coe lemmas defined, but not all of them. So I would leave all these lemmas in place for consistency and completeness, if you're okay with that.",
