              "body": "These instances seem bad to me. I expect Lean will struggle to apply then in cases that `p` is not a variable. \r\n\r\nI think that even if this is useful in LeanCamCombi, we should still (at least) scope these instances. The `-0.454 %` in type-class inference time is probably just noise, but I can also imagine that doing this for 20-50 other instances will actually give a noticeable speed improvement.\r\n\r\nI'll let @sgouezel decide if he wants to give @YaelDillies a few more days to give an example, or just to merge it outright.\r\n\r\nbors d+",
