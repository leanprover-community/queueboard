I haven't reviewed variable_alias fully, but it seems like there's at least 3 ways they could be distributed in Mathlib:\r\n\r\n* alongside whatever subfolder they \"belong to\" (which is what I've tentatively done here)\r\n* In a file called `Aliases` somewhere near the thing they alias (which seems less discoverable to me)\r\n* In a single file, a la `Mathlib.TrainingWheels` (with some less playful name) which is meant to define a bunch of more \"friendly\" aliases all in one place.\r\n\r\nI kind of like the idea of the third thing as a future module but perhaps it can be synthesized if/when there are more aliases? For now as I say I've done the first one, but please let me know if someone prefers something else.\r\n\r\n<!-- The text above the `---` will become the commit message when your\r\nPR is merged.

I just defined the alias in the 'main file' where, I think, it belongs. The planned use, after all to me, is writing [VectorSpace a] is more natural (in a file that proofs something about vector spaces) than writing the unfolding of it.\r\n\r\nIn my case, my reviewers asked me to define a mixin IsQuantale instead of having a proper class Quantale.\r\nThe latter seems more natural to me from a 'software structure' point of view, but I understand that having the mixin leads to (much?) less overhead in re-proving theorems. The alias 'saves' me, so I can define at least the structure Quantale after all - which was the point of the whole file. Hence, I feel the alias belongs there.\r\n\r\nBut then again... this is my first PR ever... so I don't really now anything ;-)\r\nCurious to learn what happens to your PR.",

I'd like the quantale PR to go through quickly, and having the `variable_alias` in there may slow down the reviewing process. It may be better to make it a separate PR after the first one got through. So I'll probably remove it for now and get back to you a.s.a.p. keeping an eye on this discussion for inspiration.",

I just defined the alias in the 'main file' where, I think, it belongs. The planned use, after all to me, is writing [VectorSpace a] is more natural (in a file that proofs something about vector spaces) than writing the unfolding of it.\r\n\r\nIn my case, my reviewers asked me to define a mixin IsQuantale instead of having a proper class Quantale.\r\nThe latter seems more natural to me from a 'software structure' point of view, but I understand that having the mixin leads to (much?) less overhead in re-proving theorems. The alias 'saves' me, so I can define at least the structure Quantale after all - which was the point of the whole file. Hence, I feel the alias belongs there.\r\n\r\nBut then again... this is my first PR ever... so I don't really now anything ;-)\r\nCurious to learn what happens to your PR.",

I'd like the quantale PR to go through quickly, and having the `variable_alias` in there may slow down the reviewing process. It may be better to make it a separate PR after the first one got through. So I'll probably remove it for now and get back to you a.s.a.p. keeping an eye on this discussion for inspiration.",
