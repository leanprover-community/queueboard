You could restate this with finsupps as saying the exponents of `CNF (b ^ e * x)` are all larger than those in `CNF y`, and that the coefficients of `CNF (b ^ e * x + y)` match either one of them depending if the exponent is larger or smaller than `e`, but that's a mouthful.\r\n\r\nSo yeah, I overall wouldn't want to see our list version of `CNF` go. Even if it's not the most natural for proving theorems, it makes the development of said API smoother.",
