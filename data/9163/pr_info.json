You should add the `awaiting-review` label to signal the PR is ready for other people to look at it. There is a special queue where only PRs with that label appear, and reviewers tend to look at that queue. When a PR is not yet ready for review, please add the label WIP. Basically never leave a PR without a label.\r\nAlso, to help sorting the PRs, adding the topic label `t-measure-probability` is helpful.\r\nI have added these labels for you now.\r\n\r\nAbout the PR: it is quite large and contains parts that should be PRed separately: the coercions between measurability properties is a big change in the way we use them, and should have its own PR. Could you open another PR with those changes, and edit the first message of this PR to note that it depends on the other one?",

I've checked two references [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tightness_of_measures) and Fremlin (258Xj, Measure Theory vol.2). Both define the term '(uniformly) tight' for a family of _measures_, with Fremlin not dropping 'uniformly'. For measures, the property refers to the uniform smallness of the measure assigned to the complement of a _compact_ set on a topological space.\r\n\r\nThe property that I defined didn't have a name in any references on Vitali's theorem that I've seen, so I named it by close analogy with the notion above. At the moment I'm happy with `UnifTight` as being sufficiently descriptive, specific and not contradicting convention (an equally good alternative could be `TightFamily`). If it is worth trying to avoid a future clash with the similarly named but distinct notion for measures, one could use instead `TightFuncFamily` or `<appropriate namespace>.UnifTight`. Alternatively, the notion for measures could be introduced in the future as `MeasureTheory.Measure.UnifTight`. Just some thoughts...",

              "body": "Thanks a lot for the PR! Sorry that it tooks weeks to react to it. The reason it was missed by the reviewers is that it lacks labels. You should add the `awaiting-review` label to signal the PR is ready for other people to look at it. There is a special queue where only PRs with that label appear, and reviewers tend to look at that queue. When a PR is not yet ready for review, please add the label WIP. Basically never leave a PR without a label.\r\nAlso, to help sorting the PRs, adding the topic label `t-measure-probability` is helpful.\r\nI have added these labels for you now.\r\n\r\nAbout the PR: it is quite large and contains parts that should be PRed separately: the coercions between measurability properties is a big change in the way we use them, and should have its own PR. Could you open another PR with those changes, and edit the first message of this PR to note that it depends on the other one?",

I've checked two references [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tightness_of_measures) and Fremlin (258Xj, Measure Theory vol.2). Both define the term '(uniformly) tight' for a family of _measures_, with Fremlin not dropping 'uniformly'. For measures, the property refers to the uniform smallness of the measure assigned to the complement of a _compact_ set on a topological space.\r\n\r\nThe property that I defined didn't have a name in any references on Vitali's theorem that I've seen, so I named it by close analogy with the notion above. At the moment I'm happy with `UnifTight` as being sufficiently descriptive, specific and not contradicting convention (an equally good alternative could be `TightFamily`). If it is worth trying to avoid a future clash with the similarly named but distinct notion for measures, one could use instead `TightFuncFamily` or `<appropriate namespace>.UnifTight`. Alternatively, the notion for measures could be introduced in the future as `MeasureTheory.Measure.UnifTight`. Just some thoughts...",
