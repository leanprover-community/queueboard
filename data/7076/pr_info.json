These are interesting suggestions, I definitely hadn't thought about this before.\r\n\r\nFor me, it's important that the notion of measure zero sets is independent of auxiliary choices. (Sard's theorem doesn't mention any such choices, for instance.) Choosing a measure on the model space or model vector space induces a measure on the manifold --- but not canonically so. (Extending from each model space to the whole manifold needs a partition of unity, I believe --- which is very far from canonical. And you might have several measures on the model space to choose from. Let alone the fact that to me, the choice of model space (among isomorphic representatives) is not canonical either, and not what the manifold is really about. In other words, depending on that also doesn't feel natural to me.)\r\n\r\nIn effect, the resulting concept is either not canonical, or one needs to argue that all these choices yield the same result. My definition is this equivalent result.\r\n\r\nI haven't yet thought much about whether your approach would yield simpler *proofs*. (I only learned about filters last Wednesday - I think they're cool, but I'm not very *used* to them yet.) If you use filter, you also have to show independence of auxiliary choices; I'm not sure how much extra work that entails.\r\n",

After all, for Sard's theorem in infinite dimensions (maps between Banach manifolds), the set of critical values is a meagre set --- there's no useful notion of \"measure zero\" any more. The right version of Sard's theorem in finite dimensions also goes in these terms, the critical set is meagre.\r\n\r\nThat said, measure zero sets are still used in the proof. (While in general, none of meagreness and measure zero implies the other, in a Baire space a $\\sigma$-compact measure zero set is meagre. The standard proof shows that the critical set has measure zero. It is also $\\sigma$-compact (the critical values are closed and the domain $M$ is $\\sigma$-compact), hence is meagre.\r\n\r\n\r\nThat is to say: I do think this definition is necessary for proving Sard's theorem. But a next step would be showing the implication above \"in a Baire space, a $\\sigma$-compact measure zero set is meagre\". (I haven't checked to what degree this is in mathlib already.)\r\n",

If you use filter, you also have to show independence of auxiliary choices; I'm not sure how much extra work that entails.\r\n\r\nThe definition I proposed using filters doesn't need extra choices in itself, all the choices happen in the choice of the filter `F` on the model space (which will simplify the proof of the result I wrote just above). I'm happy to rule out `μ.ae` for a specific `μ`, but that could be `⨆ (μ : Measure E) [IsAddHaarMeasure μ], μ.ae`, which would give out exactly your definition, without making any additional choice. \r\nMy claim is that, on top of potentially simplifying the proof, the `ae` filter on the manifold is the natural object here, because it is precisely what's needed to encode \"P(x) is true for almost every x\", and \"S has measure zero\" is just the special case \"For almost every x, x is not in S\". Does that make sense? Another example is precisely Sard's theorem, which could be stated as \"almost all points in the codomain are regular values for f\" which would be more natural to work with (thanks to the extensive filter API) than the usual \"the set of critical values has measure zero\". \r\n\r\nRegarding using meagre sets, I think the notion of measure zero definitely deserves to exist in some form, independently of meagre sets. By the way, note that we have the same kind of filter for co-meagre sets, see [eventually_residual](https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/Mathlib/Topology/MetricSpace/Baire.html#eventually_residual).",

(This uses that C¹ maps are locally Lipschitz and those preserve measure zero sets.)\r\n- define measure zero sets as null sets w.r.t. any (or equivalently, all) Lebesgue measure(s) on $M$.\r\n- deduce: $A\\subseteq M$ has measure zero iff $\\phi(U\\cap A)$ has measure zero (w.r.t. the Haar measure), for each chart $(\\phi,U)$ of $M$\r\n- the countable intersection filter is then a special case of the a.e. filter on a general measure space.\r\n\r\n@ADedecker As I understand I, you suggest a different description of the a.e. filter on $M$: choose an a.e. filter on the model space $F$ (or even a measure) and define the a.e. filter on `M` using that. (The a.e. filter for the Haar measure should be canonical, as the Haar measure on Euclidean space is unique up to a multiplicative constant. Neat!)\r\n\r\nIt seems to me these ideas are complementary, and having both would certainly be worthwhile.\r\n\r\n------\r\n\r\nIn all applications I know (using Sard's theorem), measure zero sets are never used \"constructively\": you care that a particular property is generic, but you never need to know (nor care) if a *particular* set has measure zero.

Making this definition more workable by relating to the Lebesgue measure is not a priority for me personally; yet, this is certainly useful and belongs to mathlib.\r\n\r\nI'm unsure of the best way forward.

In the above, I see requests to\r\n- define a Lebesgue measure on (finite-dimensional) manifolds and define measure zero sets this way\r\n(then deducing the equivalence to the current definition)\r\n- write the almost everywhere filter in terms of the filter in charts\r\n\r\nI'm ready to do (1), but there is one catch: constructing Lebesgue measure on a manifold commonly proceeds using Riemannian metrics. (For instance, as \"for each Riemannian metric on M, there's a corresponding Lebesgue measure\" and showing that measure zero sets are independent of this choice.) As I understand it, however, Riemannian metrics are still some way off, in the sense that @hrmacbeth has a definition written down which is not suitable for entering mathlib yet.\r\n\r\nMore generally, that seems like a phenomenal expansion of this PR's scope, as it would entail\r\n1. defining oriented atlasses and orientations of a finite-dimensional manifold\r\n2. some definition of Riemannian metric\r\n(yes, there is a theory of sprays for Banach manifolds: perhaps we can restrict to finite-dimensional manifolds for now)\r\n3. showing finite-dimensional smooth manifolds admit a Riemannian metric\r\n4. use that to define a Lebesgue measure\r\n5. show there is a unique Lebesgue measure, given a Riemannian metric\r\nAll of this is good and useful work, but need it block this PR?\r\n\r\nIs there some middle ground: for instance, by\r\n- defining continuous Riemannian metrics for now\r\n(upgrading this to smooth can happen when the kinks with smooth vector bundles are ironed out)\r\n- defining the Lebesgue measure\r\n- showing that a set has measure zero iff each image in charts has; this also shows independence of the chosen measure\r\n\r\n@sgouezel I would be interested in your opinion here.",

              "body": "I have a few mathematical suggestions/options/random thoughts. They don't necessarily have to be taken into account for this PR, but I want to at least discuss them with you and @fpvandoorn (in fact you may have discussed some of them already in person). Disclaimer: I'm neither a geometer nor a measure theorist, but I'm a filter enthusiast :grin: \r\n\r\nRegarding which measure to consider, here are three natural options that come to my mind:\r\n1. You could pick a measure `μ` on the model space `E` and use that everywhere.\r\n2. If choosing a measure is too much, maybe it's better to choose a filter (probably with countable intersection) of declared co-null sets on the model space. \r\n3. Even if you want to only consider Haar measures, I think it's better to first define the filter of co-negligible sets for all/any Haar measure on the model space, and then move to manifolds. I think separating the two steps could make your life easier, for example showing that you only have to check *one* Haar measure will trivially follow from the case of the model space. I'm not sure if I'm clear here, feel free to ask for details :sweat_smile: \r\n\r\nThen, assuming you've fixed a filter `F` of co-null sets on your model space (either by 1., 2., or 3.), I think you can construct the `ae` filter directly as `⨆ e ∈ atlas H M, (comap (I ∘ e) F) ⊓ 𝓟 e.source`. I haven't tested it in Lean, but I'm pretty sure you recover your definition by using [Filter.mem_iSup](https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/Mathlib/Order/Filter/Basic.html#Filter.mem_iSup), [Filter.mem_inf_principal'](https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/Mathlib/Order/Filter/Basic.html#Filter.mem_inf_principal') and [Filter.compl_mem_comap](https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/Mathlib/Order/Filter/Basic.html#Filter.compl_mem_comap). I claim that this is, at least morally, the right way to define it, and then you can work with this filter as much as possible (in particular, being a null set is the same as being eventually equal to the empty set for this filter). \r\n\r\nRegarding notation, one possibility (definitely not in scope for this PR) would be to define an intermediate between `MeasurableSpace` and `MeasureSpace` where you don't have the measure yet but you know which sets are negligible. This would work well with option 2. above, but this would be a big refactor and I'm not sure how useful it is.",

They don't necessarily have to be taken into account for this PR, but I want to at least discuss them with you and @fpvandoorn (in fact you may have discussed some of them already in person). Disclaimer: I'm neither a geometer nor a measure theorist, but I'm a filter enthusiast 😁\r\n> \r\n> Regarding which measure to consider, here are three natural options that come to my mind:\r\n> \r\n>     1. You could pick a measure `μ` on the model space `E` and use that everywhere.\r\n> \r\n>     2. If choosing a measure is too much, maybe it's better to choose a filter (probably with countable intersection) of declared co-null sets on the model space.\r\n> \r\n>     3. Even if you want to only consider Haar measures, I think it's better to first define the filter of co-negligible sets for all/any Haar measure on the model space, and then move to manifolds. I think separating the two steps could make your life easier, for example showing that you only have to check _one_ Haar measure will trivially follow from the case of the model space. I'm not sure if I'm clear here, feel free to ask for details 😅\r\n> \r\n> \r\n> Then, assuming you've fixed a filter `F` of co-null sets on your model space (either by 1., 2., or 3.), I think you can construct the `ae` filter directly as `⨆ e ∈ atlas H M, (comap (I ∘ e) F) ⊓ 𝓟 e.source`. I haven't tested it in Lean, but I'm pretty sure you recover your definition by using [Filter.mem_iSup](https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/Mathlib/Order/Filter/Basic.html#Filter.mem_iSup), [Filter.mem_inf_principal'](https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/Mathlib/Order/Filter/Basic.html#Filter.mem_inf_principal') and [Filter.compl_mem_comap](https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/Mathlib/Order/Filter/Basic.html#Filter.compl_mem_comap). I claim that this is, at least morally, the right way to define it, and then you can work with this filter as much as possible (in particular, being a null set is the same as being eventually equal to the empty set for this filter).\r\n> \r\n> Regarding notation, one possibility (definitely not in scope for this PR) would be to define an intermediate between `MeasurableSpace` and `MeasureSpace` where you don't have the measure yet but you know which sets are negligible. This would work well with option 2. above, but this would be a big refactor and I'm not sure how useful it is.\r\n\r\nThanks for the fast response! These are interesting suggestions, I definitely hadn't thought about this before.\r\n\r\nFor me, it's important that the notion of measure zero sets is independent of auxiliary choices. (Sard's theorem doesn't mention any such choices, for instance.) Choosing a measure on the model space or model vector space induces a measure on the manifold --- but not canonically so. (Extending from each model space to the whole manifold needs a partition of unity, I believe --- which is very far from canonical. And you might have several measures on the model space to choose from. Let alone the fact that to me, the choice of model space (among isomorphic representatives) is not canonical either, and not what the manifold is really about. In other words, depending on that also doesn't feel natural to me.)\r\n\r\nIn effect, the resulting concept is either not canonical, or one needs to argue that all these choices yield the same result. My definition is this equivalent result.\r\n\r\nI haven't yet thought much about whether your approach would yield simpler *proofs*. (I only learned about filters last Wednesday - I think they're cool, but I'm not very *used* to them yet.) If you use filter, you also have to show independence of auxiliary choices; I'm not sure how much extra work that entails.\r\n",

After all, for Sard's theorem in infinite dimensions (maps between Banach manifolds), the set of critical values is a meagre set --- there's no useful notion of \"measure zero\" any more. The right version of Sard's theorem in finite dimensions also goes in these terms, the critical set is meagre.\r\n\r\nThat said, measure zero sets are still used in the proof. (While in general, none of meagreness and measure zero implies the other, in a Baire space a $\\sigma$-compact measure zero set is meagre. The standard proof shows that the critical set has measure zero. It is also $\\sigma$-compact (the critical values are closed and the domain $M$ is $\\sigma$-compact), hence is meagre.\r\n\r\n\r\nThat is to say: I do think this definition is necessary for proving Sard's theorem. But a next step would be showing the implication above \"in a Baire space, a $\\sigma$-compact measure zero set is meagre\". (I haven't checked to what degree this is in mathlib already.)\r\n",

I'm happy to rule out `μ.ae` for a specific `μ`, but that could be `⨆ (μ : Measure E) [IsAddHaarMeasure μ], μ.ae`, which would give out exactly your definition, without making any additional choice. \r\nMy claim is that, on top of potentially simplifying the proof, the `ae` filter on the manifold is the natural object here, because it is precisely what's needed to encode \"P(x) is true for almost every x\", and \"S has measure zero\" is just the special case \"For almost every x, x is not in S\". Does that make sense? Another example is precisely Sard's theorem, which could be stated as \"almost all points in the codomain are regular values for f\" which would be more natural to work with (thanks to the extensive filter API) than the usual \"the set of critical values has measure zero\". \r\n\r\nRegarding using meagre sets, I think the notion of measure zero definitely deserves to exist in some form, independently of meagre sets.

My impression is that we all agree the statements in the PR (measure zero sets on a manifold generate a filter, which is closed under countable intersections) are worthwhile, we're just discussing the best way to prove them.\r\n\r\n@sgouezel If I understand correctly, you suggest to\r\n- define a Lebesgue measure on each $C^1$ (e.g., smooth) manifold by pulling back the Lebesgue measure on each chart and using a partition of unity\r\n- show that if $\\mu$ and $\\mu'$ are two such Lebesgue measure, we have $\\mu(A)=0$ iff $\\mu'(A)=0$. (This uses that C¹ maps are locally Lipschitz and those preserve measure zero sets.)\r\n- define measure zero sets as null sets w.r.t. any (or equivalently, all) Lebesgue measure(s) on $M$.\r\n- deduce: $A\\subseteq M$ has measure zero iff $\\phi(U\\cap A)$ has measure zero (w.r.t. the Haar measure), for each chart $(\\phi,U)$ of $M$\r\n- the countable intersection filter is then a special case of the a.e. filter on a general measure space.\r\n\r\n@ADedecker As I understand I, you suggest a different description of the a.e. filter on $M$: choose an a.e. filter on the model space $F$ (or even a measure) and define the a.e. filter on `M` using that. (The a.e. filter for the Haar measure should be canonical, as the Haar measure on Euclidean space is unique up to a multiplicative constant. Neat!)\r\n\r\nIt seems to me these ideas are complementary, and having both would certainly be worthwhile.\r\n\r\n------\r\n\r\nIn all applications I know (using Sard's theorem), measure zero sets are never used \"constructively\": you care that a particular property is generic, but you never need to know (nor care) if a *particular* set has measure zero. (I can imagine some applications care about this.) Making this definition more workable by relating to the Lebesgue measure is not a priority for me personally; yet, this is certainly useful and belongs to mathlib.\r\n\r\nI'm unsure of the best way forward. My lean time in the next few months is rather limited; I'm not sure if I have the capacity to redo the proof as above *soon*.
