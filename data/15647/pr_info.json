To prove that the resulting declarations are usable, can you prove the basic equation lemmas for them, i.e. write that API showing that the definitions produce what you expect them to produce for the empty and option inputs?\r\n\r\nThank you for bringing this to my attention! I've re-written the definition, but since it's a bit awkward to reduce, the lemmas you mentioned are now provided, as well. I would've loved to state them in terms of `IsEmpty` and `NonEmpty`, but that would've made the required proof arguments on the RHSs even more bloated. Since I didn't want those derivations to go to waste, though, I've added them to `FinEnum.lean`. I fear that I might've gone a bit overboard in providing `FinEnum` instances for all `IsEmpty` and `Unique` types, as that's what leads to `simp` now finding more lemmas via typeclass inference.\r\n\r\nAre there any recommendations on how to deal with those? Or should I just scrap the generic instances? I don't think the remark that accompanies [`Fintype.ofIsEmpty`](https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/Mathlib/Data/Fintype/Basic.html#Fintype.ofIsEmpty) is applicable here, due to `IsEmpty α → Unique (FinEnum α)` implying there cannot be two observably conflicting `FinEnum α` instances. Though I would suppose the same goes for `Fintype α`, so maybe I don't understand the remark thoroughly enough…",

To prove that the resulting declarations are usable, can you prove the basic equation lemmas for them, i.e. write that API showing that the definitions produce what you expect them to produce for the empty and option inputs?\r\n\r\nThank you for bringing this to my attention! I've re-written the definition, but since it's a bit awkward to reduce, the lemmas you mentioned are now provided, as well. I would've loved to state them in terms of `IsEmpty` and `NonEmpty`, but that would've made the required proof arguments on the RHSs even more bloated. Since I didn't want those derivations to go to waste, though, I've added them to `FinEnum.lean`. I fear that I might've gone a bit overboard in providing `FinEnum` instances for all `IsEmpty` and `Unique` types, as that's what leads to `simp` now finding more lemmas via typeclass inference.\r\n\r\nAre there any recommendations on how to deal with those? Or should I just scrap the generic instances? I don't think the remark that accompanies [`Fintype.ofIsEmpty`](https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/Mathlib/Data/Fintype/Basic.html#Fintype.ofIsEmpty) is applicable here, due to `IsEmpty α → Unique (FinEnum α)` implying there cannot be two observably conflicting `FinEnum α` instances. Though I would suppose the same goes for `Fintype α`, so maybe I don't understand the remark thoroughly enough…",
