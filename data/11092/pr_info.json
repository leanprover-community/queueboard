This PR was supposed to be just a fix to few bugs but then it got blocked because there was tons of missing docs. I got a bit frustrated by it as I didn't have the time to write it back then.

Hopefully I have addressed all your comments.\r\n\r\nI added a new option `maxTransitionDepth` and `transitionDepth` context variable which limits how many transition theorems can be used. This allowed for few simplification. Logging happens only with `transitionDepth=0` and `thrmStack` has been completely removed which was an incomplete solution to prevent loops anyway. ",

Create an option\r\n\r\n```\r\nregister_option Meta.Tactic.fun_prop.errors : Bool := {\r\n  defValue := false\r\n  descr := \"yada yada\" }\r\n```\r\n\r\nand then use `if Meta.Tactic.fun_prop.errors.get (← getOptions) then` whenever you want to add a \"secondary\" log message. (this approach does not sort them as main/secondary, but seems much simpler)\r\n\r\n### Option B\r\n\r\nJust use `trace[Meta.Tactic.fun_prop.errors]` wherever you have these secondary error messages, don't bother about the sorting and have the error say something like \"enable `set_option trace.Meta.Tactic.fun_prop.errors true` to see more details!\" No need for the \"LoggingMode\" either.\r\n\r\n### Option C\r\nIf you really think adding `LoggingMode` adds value, I'd still suggest you use `register_option` instead of `registerTraceClass`.\r\n\r\nIn any case, it would be nice to have a test in the dev-test file using `#guard_msgs` which demonstrates the expected error message, would help understanding and reviewing..",

This PR was supposed to be just a fix to few bugs but then it got blocked because there was tons of missing docs. I got a bit frustrated by it as I didn't have the time to write it back then. As it is now bug fixes+doc PR I thought I can also squeeze update to logging.\r\n\r\nAnyway, thanks a lot for picking on logging as I definitely left it half unfinished. I will clean it up now!",

Hopefully I have addressed all your comments.\r\n\r\nI added a new option `maxTransitionDepth` and `transitionDepth` context variable which limits how many transition theorems can be used. This allowed for few simplification. Logging happens only with `transitionDepth=0` and `thrmStack` has been completely removed which was an incomplete solution to prevent loops anyway. ",
