For example `append_left` (which could be called `mul_congr_left`) could just be a general lemma about `ConGen.Rel` right?\r\n\r\nI am happy to change it; here is my reasoning:\r\n\r\nThis hides the fact that presented monoids are implemented as quotients of congruence relations. \r\n\r\nFor one, users can simply use the presented monoid interface without worrying about its implementation, and going digging in other files to get what they need. \r\n\r\nSecondly, it is entirely conceivable that presented monoids might be re-implemented in a different way in the future (eventually, I will be PR'ing some things about Semi-Thue systems, defined as the reflexive, transitive, multiplicative (not symmetric!) closure of a relation. Presented monoids are also called Thue systems, and maybe people will think it is better to implement them similarly to Thue systems)\r\n\r\nLastly, I can envision having some iff lemmas; if they are defined only for ConGen, then I would have to unfold PresentedMonoid in order to `rw` with them\r\n\r\n(Overall, I thought to add these to PresentedMonoid rather than in Con because of PresentedMonoid's second interpretation as a string re-writing system, so I want to provide good support for that use case --- of which I have made much use in my braid monoid proofs)",

              "body": "> It is not clear (to me) why this definition is needed. We have `ConGen.Rel` already, this redefines it in a special case, duplicates some API and adds more API which could just be added to ConGen.Rel already couldn't it? For example `append_left` (which could be called `mul_congr_left`) could just be a general lemma about `ConGen.Rel` right?\r\n\r\nI am happy to change it; here is my reasoning:\r\n\r\nThis hides the fact that presented monoids are implemented as quotients of congruence relations. \r\n\r\nFor one, users can simply use the presented monoid interface without worrying about its implementation, and going digging in other files to get what they need. \r\n\r\nSecondly, it is entirely conceivable that presented monoids might be re-implemented in a different way in the future (eventually, I will be PR'ing some things about Semi-Thue systems, defined as the reflexive, transitive, multiplicative (not symmetric!) closure of a relation. Presented monoids are also called Thue systems, and maybe people will think it is better to implement them similarly to Thue systems)\r\n\r\nLastly, I can envision having some iff lemmas; if they are defined only for ConGen, then I would have to unfold PresentedMonoid in order to `rw` with them\r\n\r\n(Overall, I thought to add these to PresentedMonoid rather than in Con because of PresentedMonoid's second interpretation as a string re-writing system, so I want to provide good support for that use case --- of which I have made much use in my braid monoid proofs)",
