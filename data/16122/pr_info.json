For example in the finsupp file it's proved that `(ι →₀ R) ⊗[R] (κ →₀ R) ≃ₗ[R] ι × κ →₀ R`, whereas we prove that `(ι → R) ⊗[R] (κ → R) ≃ₗ[R] ι × κ → R` if either `ι` or `κ` are finite (allowing the other to be infinite, so it's not covered by the Finsupp result). \r\n\r\nI am sad that we can't use `calc` to make the defs in this PR (which are all of the form \"compose this isomorphism with this one (and then possibly with this one)\") so I have written out the definitions in \"calc style\" to make them easier to understand. In particular they can certainly be golfed by removing all the intermediate types and replacing many explicit types with `_`, and I would regard this as a step backwards.\r\n\r\n[![Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io/from-referrer/)\r\n",
