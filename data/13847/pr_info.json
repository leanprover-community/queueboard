        "body": "+ Define the universal Weierstrass curve (`Universal.curve`) over the polynomial ring `ℤ[A₁,A₂,A₃,A₄,A₆]`, and the universal pointed elliptic curve (`Universal.pointedCurve`) over the field of fractions (`Universal.Field`) of the universal ring `ℤ[A₁,A₂,A₃,A₄,A₆,X,Y]/⟨P⟩ = Universal.Poly/⟨P⟩` (`Universal.Ring`, where `P` is the Weierstrass polynomial) with distinguished point `(X,Y)`.\r\n\r\n+ Given a Weierstrass curve `W` over a commutative ring `R`, we define the specialization homomorphism `W.specialize : ℤ[A₁,A₂,A₃,A₄,A₆] →+* R`. If `(x,y)` is a point on the affine plane, we define `W.polyEval x y : Universal.Poly →+* R`, which factors through `W.ringEval x y : Universal.Ring →+* R` if `(x,y)` is on `W`.\r\n\r\n+ Introduce the cusp curve `Y² = X³`, on which lies the rational point `(1,1)`, with the nice property that `ψₙ(1,1) = n`, making it easy to prove nonvanishing of the universal `ψₙ` when `n ≠ 0` by specializing to the cusp curve, which shows that `(X,Y)` is a point of infinite order on the universal pointed elliptic curve.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n- [x] depends on: #13845\r\n- [x] depends on: #12883 \r\n\r\n<!-- The text above the `---` will become the commit message when your\r\nPR is merged.

Yes I agree that for a Weierstrass curve W over comm. ring R you can define a \"universal\" Weierstrass curve over the coordinate ring R[W] with a distinguished point (X,Y) on it, such that every point (x,y) on W is the specialization of the distinguished point under the ring homomorphism R[W]->R sending X to x and Y to y. As I remarked [here](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/blob/3d6da3dc779ad9a87bb94300bdc06f793e122d4e/Mathlib/AlgebraicGeometry/EllipticCurve/DivisionPolynomial/ZSMul.lean#L68-L72), you can almost prove the ZSMul formula using this less universal ring, but it would not be so easy to show ψₙ ≠ 0 when n ≠ 0 if the characteristic divides n, and in char 2 there's an additional issue.\r\n\r\nI'll try to refactor my code with generalized definitions, thanks for mentioning this!",

I'll make a subbranch (hopefully I don't mess it up again!).\r\n\r\nI think you said it [here](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/13399#issuecomment-2163491010). Yes I agree that for a Weierstrass curve W over comm. ring R you can define a \"universal\" Weierstrass curve over the coordinate ring R[W] with a distinguished point (X,Y) on it, such that every point (x,y) on W is the specialization of the distinguished point under the ring homomorphism R[W]->R sending X to x and Y to y. As I remarked [here](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/blob/3d6da3dc779ad9a87bb94300bdc06f793e122d4e/Mathlib/AlgebraicGeometry/EllipticCurve/DivisionPolynomial/ZSMul.lean#L68-L72), you can almost prove the ZSMul formula using this less universal ring, but it would not be so easy to show ψₙ ≠ 0 when n ≠ 0 if the characteristic divides n, and in char 2 there's an additional issue.\r\n\r\nI'll try to refactor my code with generalized definitions, thanks for mentioning this!",
