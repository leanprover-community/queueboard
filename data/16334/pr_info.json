I am not sure if this will ever get merged... so my thinking is to start with a linter here, and refine later if the batteries script gets merged.\r\n\r\nIn terms of functionality, both do very similar things: the main difference is that this script is integrated with the text-based linters. Batteries has no such infrastructure currently, so needs to invent their own. Mathlib already has something which fits well.\r\nNow, batteries could easily gain such infrastructure (I could uplift the text-based linter functionality there, and wait for it to get merged...), but it's less obvious to me how useful that would be. In summary: unless batteries wants to get such functionality, the effort of designing some ad-hoc infrastructure for running the trailing whitespace script and then figuring out how to use that in mathlib seems much higher than just landing the script here, and manually running it on batteries every now and then.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think? Or should one simply try to upstream the text-based linter infrastructure there?",

I am not sure if this will ever get merged... so my thinking is to start with a linter here, and refine later if the batteries script gets merged.\r\n\r\nIn terms of functionality, both do very similar things: the main difference is that this script is integrated with the text-based linters. Batteries has no such infrastructure currently, so needs to invent their own. Mathlib already has something which fits well.\r\nNow, batteries could easily gain such infrastructure (I could uplift the text-based linter functionality there, and wait for it to get merged...), but it's less obvious to me how useful that would be. In summary: unless batteries wants to get such functionality, the effort of designing some ad-hoc infrastructure for running the trailing whitespace script and then figuring out how to use that in mathlib seems much higher than just landing the script here, and manually running it on batteries every now and then.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think? Or should one simply try to upstream the text-based linter infrastructure there?",
