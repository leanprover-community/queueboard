        "body": "This PR \"completes\" the checks implied by `assert_not_exists` and `assert_not_imported`: at the time of using one of those commands, the declarations/imports are not present in the environment.\r\n\r\nNow, each time that one of the commands above is used, the information is recorded in the environment, so that running `#check_assertions` reports the status of each one.\r\n\r\nIf `#check_assertions` finds that something is still missing, then it emits a warning, otherwise it just logs the report.\r\n\r\nThe `#check_assertions!` variant is silent unless some declaration/import is missing and, in that case, it only prints what is missing.  This is useful for testing.\r\n\r\nThere is also the extra file `test/AssertImported.lean` consisting of\r\n```lean\r\nimport Mathlib\r\n\r\n#check_assertions!\r\n```\r\nto make sure that CI fails if there are non-existing imports/declarations.\r\n\r\n---\r\n<!-- The text above the `---` will become the commit message when your\r\nPR is merged.

I think this is good for an initial commit so I don't think we should go back now but the feedback in CI for failure was a bit earlier.\r\n\r\nThis is very easy: it just suffices to add a step that builds `test/AssertImported`, failing if there is any sort of output.  Let me know if you want me to add it back in this PR or in a follow up.\r\n\r\n> Aside: why are we building the archive and counterexamples so high up in the workflow?\r\n\r\nI do not know the reason for this, but both steps are relatively short.\r\n\r\nIn fact, I had it in the back of my mind to run `Archive`, `Counterexamples`, `tests` and `linting` in parallel, as soon as the cache has been checked.  Each would be its own separate workflow that downloads the cache and does its thing.  What stopped me from implementing this was that I could not find a way to make the github actions contingent on the success of a *different* action.  The issue might have been that the logic for this was supposed to be on `master` and could not be tested on a branch.",

              "body": "> > Actually, the CI step is already embedded in the tests: one of the files calls the `#check_assertions!` command with `import Mathlib`: the command is noisy if and only if there are non-existent declarations or imports.\r\n> \r\n> I kinda liked the previous incarnation. I think this is good for an initial commit so I don't think we should go back now but the feedback in CI for failure was a bit earlier.\r\n\r\nThis is very easy: it just suffices to add a step that builds `test/AssertImported`, failing if there is any sort of output.  Let me know if you want me to add it back in this PR or in a follow up.\r\n\r\n> Aside: why are we building the archive and counterexamples so high up in the workflow?\r\n\r\nI do not know the reason for this, but both steps are relatively short.\r\n\r\nIn fact, I had it in the back of my mind to run `Archive`, `Counterexamples`, `tests` and `linting` in parallel, as soon as the cache has been checked.  Each would be its own separate workflow that downloads the cache and does its thing.  What stopped me from implementing this was that I could not find a way to make the github actions contingent on the success of a *different* action.  The issue might have been that the logic for this was supposed to be on `master` and could not be tested on a branch.",
