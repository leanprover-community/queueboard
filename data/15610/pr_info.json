A value of `0` silences the linter entirely.\r\n\r\nThis PR also modifies the `TextBased` `fileTooLong` linter: now it only lints files that do not contain `set_option linter.style.longFile `, and removes the exceptions that are now covered by the \"longFile\" linter.\r\n\r\nThe `TextBased` longFile linter stays (for now), though it is going to be removed soon.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nOnce #15845 lands, the text-based linter can be removed.\r\n\r\nI tried setting the default option for the linter to 0 and then modifying it in the lakefile to be 1500 for Mathlib, but I could not get it to work.\r\n\r\n<!-- The text above the `---` will become the commit message when your\r\nPR is merged.

Currently, it counts the number of \"long file\" style exceptions; can you ensure to also count the number of \"set_option linter.longFile\" (and add these... if a shell script allows this)?\r\n- as I said already: a syntax linter has much nicer user experience; thanks for upgrading the text-based linter even further!",

Currently, it counts the number of \"long file\" style exceptions; can you ensure to also count the number of \"set_option linter.longFile\" (and add these... if a shell script allows this)?\r\n- as I said already: a syntax linter has much nicer user experience; thanks for upgrading the text-based linter even further!",
