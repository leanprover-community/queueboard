I haven't tested it against mathlib, but the test file passes at least.\r\n\r\nThe main changes:\r\n1. make the `rel?` function use `FunInfo` data to figure out which are the explicit arguments and how many implicit arguments to include immediately after the relation\r\n2. make the `@[trans]` attribute use this function, and add more consistency checks\r\n3. fix `transCore` to use syntheticOpaque instead of synthetic metavariables; also fix how it handles metavariables in y\r\n4. fix the way the `trans` tactic handles the metavariables that `elabTermWithHoles` returns, rather than discarding them",

We might instead just reorder the arguments of `Set.EqOn` (most uses are via dot notation in any case). What do you think?

Reordering arguments seems reasonable to me.\r\n\r\nAnother thing, which would take more development, would be to create a system (an attribute maybe?) to declare relations so that you can specify which argument indices correspond to the LHS and RHS. I think Lean 3 sort of maintained such a database automatically, but I don't remember being able to configure it in any way. (I think `@[trans]` lemmas were also really restrictive and had to be in the form `lem ... x y z (h1 : R x y) (h2 : R y z) : R x z`, at least to work with `calc`, but the `transitivity` tactic accidentally worked more generally.)",

Haven't investigated why, but I put a simple test case in the test file.\r\n\r\nSecond, your refactor doesn't cope with\r\n```\r\n@[trans]\r\ntheorem EqOn.trans (h₁ : EqOn f₁ f₂ s) (h₂ : EqOn f₂ f₃ s) : EqOn f₁ f₃ s := fun _ hx =>\r\n  (h₁ hx).trans (h₂ hx)\r\n```\r\n\r\nI think it's actually pretty reasonable to not cope with this! We might instead just reorder the arguments of `Set.EqOn` (most uses are via dot notation in any case). What do you think?

Reordering arguments seems reasonable to me.\r\n\r\nAnother thing, which would take more development, would be to create a system (an attribute maybe?) to declare relations so that you can specify which argument indices correspond to the LHS and RHS. I think Lean 3 sort of maintained such a database automatically, but I don't remember being able to configure it in any way. (I think `@[trans]` lemmas were also really restrictive and had to be in the form `lem ... x y z (h1 : R x y) (h2 : R y z) : R x z`, at least to work with `calc`, but the `transitivity` tactic accidentally worked more generally.)",
