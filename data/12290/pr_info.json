This was a part of my planned Prokhorov's theorem proof, which I haven't done yet, however. Of course for locally compact spaces one needs your compactly supported continuous functions anyway! So both choices come with a trade-off.\r\n\r\nTo clarify a bit, I thought on compact spaces it was worth having the bounded continuous function version, since the dual norm topology then coincides with the total variation distance on finite measures and probability measures (because bounded continuous functions readily have the sup-norm instance), whereas the weak-* topology is exactly the topology of convergence in distribution. (Ok, to get the literal dual norm, one would have to cast to real values, but the weak-* topology would work directly on the `NNReal` semiring module `BoundedContinuousFunction X NNReal`.)\r\n\r\nSo I still don't have a clear view on what is the best way to implement Riesz representation theorem in Mathlib (but I would definitely like to have it in Mathlib!), although I admit to being somewhat attached to the idea that it would work seamlessly with probability theory and this is what guided my suggestion for Jesse's implementation. However, if Riesz representation is implemented with compactly supported bounded functions, then I would just add some glue to connect it to probability theory. And maybe the locally compact case is then more straightforward (Jesse and I did not do that).\r\n\r\nSorry that this is not really a review of your PR, but rather a continuation from the [discussion on Zulip](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/287929-mathlib4/topic/variations.20of.20Urysohn's.20lemma/near/434005302).\r\n\r\nMainly, I think much of this PR can be simplified, and I wanted to at least mention that now `NNReal` values are no longer the big problem that they were up until now. (They are still occasionally harder to work with than real values, but on the other hand, they are somewhat more consistent with the measure theory part of the library).",

(Jesse and I never wrote more than the compact case.) For certain probability purposes I will still want the bounded continuous function spelling, but it should be easy (and natural for Mathlib) to derive it from general case that you have. I will try to help review your PRs about that, but I'm not very experienced with reviewing and it might still take at least a week before I get to properly trying.

(they are not instances to avoid loop? I just followed what is done for `ZeroAtInfty`)\r\n\r\nThere is another question between `Real`/`NNReal`. @sgouezel suggested that such a code duplication is unavoidable. So maybe this PR should be done in `NNReal` and I will make a separate PR with `Real`?",

For instance the approach to define Lebesgue measure using Riesz-Markov-Kakutani is first to define a linear form on continuous compactly supported functions using the classical Riemann integral, and then apply the theorem to get Lebesgue (note that we won't use this approach as we already have Lebesgue measure in mathlib, this is just for illustrative purposes). But Riemann integral doesn't define a linear form on all continuous functions, only on compactly supported ones!",

I pick a positive number `δ` and set `N = (b-a)/δ`. I take `y : ℕ → ℝ` in such a way that `y 0 < a < y 1 < y 2 < ... < y ⌈N⌉₊ = b` and `y (m+1) - y m < δ`.\r\n\r\nThe propositions around this part are the properties of `y`, such as monotonicity, `y 0 < a`, etc.",

This was a part of my planned Prokhorov's theorem proof, which I haven't done yet, however. Of course for locally compact spaces one needs your compactly supported continuous functions anyway! So both choices come with a trade-off.\r\n\r\nTo clarify a bit, I thought on compact spaces it was worth having the bounded continuous function version, since the dual norm topology then coincides with the total variation distance on finite measures and probability measures (because bounded continuous functions readily have the sup-norm instance), whereas the weak-* topology is exactly the topology of convergence in distribution. (Ok, to get the literal dual norm, one would have to cast to real values, but the weak-* topology would work directly on the `NNReal` semiring module `BoundedContinuousFunction X NNReal`.)\r\n\r\nSo I still don't have a clear view on what is the best way to implement Riesz representation theorem in Mathlib (but I would definitely like to have it in Mathlib!), although I admit to being somewhat attached to the idea that it would work seamlessly with probability theory and this is what guided my suggestion for Jesse's implementation. However, if Riesz representation is implemented with compactly supported bounded functions, then I would just add some glue to connect it to probability theory. And maybe the locally compact case is then more straightforward (Jesse and I did not do that).\r\n\r\nSorry that this is not really a review of your PR, but rather a continuation from the [discussion on Zulip](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/287929-mathlib4/topic/variations.20of.20Urysohn's.20lemma/near/434005302).\r\n\r\nMainly, I think much of this PR can be simplified, and I wanted to at least mention that now `NNReal` values are no longer the big problem that they were up until now. (They are still occasionally harder to work with than real values, but on the other hand, they are somewhat more consistent with the measure theory part of the library).",

              "body": "> Nice! I am not sure how to proceed: I wrote myself the characterization of the measure for linear `Λ`, although it needs much refactoring (one remaining `sorry` is just a variation of Urysohn's lemma, I am planning to add it in a separate PR). https://github.com/yoh-tanimoto/mathlib4/blob/yoh/yoh/RMK/linearRMK.lean\r\n> \r\n> The bundled definition of compactly supported functions is underway #12402\r\n\r\nActually, since you have the RMK theorem for the general locally compact case, I now think the best approach for Mathlib is indeed to get your version to Mathlib. (Jesse and I never wrote more than the compact case.) For certain probability purposes I will still want the bounded continuous function spelling, but it should be easy (and natural for Mathlib) to derive it from general case that you have. I will try to help review your PRs about that, but I'm not very experienced with reviewing and it might still take at least a week before I get to properly trying. Overall, it is great that you have the general RMK and that you are PRing it. Thank you!",

(they are not instances to avoid loop? I just followed what is done for `ZeroAtInfty`)\r\n\r\nThere is another question between `Real`/`NNReal`. @sgouezel suggested that such a code duplication is unavoidable. So maybe this PR should be done in `NNReal` and I will make a separate PR with `Real`?",

For example, to have an object of `boundLU`, one has to prove `hab` and would like to use `ha` `hb`, but I get something like `ha : ∀ (self : boundLU ?m.39063), self.a ∈ lowerBounds L` and not `a ∈ lowerBounds L`.",

That's what dot notation is for: There's no difference between having `hab` as a field of `boundLU` and proving `boundLU.hab` after the fact.\r\n2. `hab` is a bad name for a structure field and it should be changed anyway.",
