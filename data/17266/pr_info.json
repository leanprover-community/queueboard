For now I just have some passing comments:\r\n\r\n1.  The way I think about this is that if $V$ is a vector space then a choice of codimension-one affine subspace $H$ which does not contain the origin induces a bijection $ℙV \\simeq H ⊔ ℙH$ (according to whether a line in $V$ meets $H$ or not). In the case that $V$ is two-dimensional, this means $H$ is one-dimensional and so $H$ is a line and $ℙH$ is a point. I can't help wondering if we might be able to simplify some of the proofs here by factoring them through this more abstract approach.\r\n2. Notwithstanding the above, I admit it is may be worth giving special attention to situation (currently proposed) where $V$ is the plane and $H$ is the horizontal line through $(0, 1)$.\r\n3. It looks like some of the results require `Field K` where `DivisionRing K` should work? This is not just Mathlib silliness: I think it is important that we can cover the case of the quaternionic projective line.\r\n\r\nAnyway as I say, I'll return at the weekend and give do some proper feedback, and in the meantime, thanks again.",

Each line in the first class is uniquely determined by its point of intersection with `H` and so we can identify this subset of `ℙ V` with `H`. The lines in the second class each uniquely determine a line in `H` by translating the origin of `V` to the distinguished point of `H`.

I decided to write a reply [on Zulip](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/channel/287929-mathlib4/topic/Projective.20extended.20real.20line/near/479252033) for greater visibility. Hopefully I got it correct!",

              "body": "Thank you very much for taking this up. I have finally had time to take a close look.\r\n\r\nEven though this is very nice work, I have quite a few suggestions. Some of these are just aspects of Mathlib style that there is no way to know in advance. Some detailed high-level remarks are as follows:\r\n 1. Using `open Classical` is almost always undesirable, and is undesirable here. We should use `[DecidableEq K]` instead here. (I will omit the detailed explanation for now, but can provide it upon request.)\r\n 2. Almost all the definitions / lemmas are auxiliary to the main construction with no value once you have `divSlope_equiv`. If possible we should thus avoid creating them.\r\n 3. I think we should use `K × K` instead of `Fin 2 → K` because this is more convenient and the result does not generalise beyond dimension two (more precisely it generalises in a different direction: to spheres, rather than projective spaces).\r\n 4. When authoring a new definition like `divSlope_equiv` we should almost always create API that defines its behaviour so that downstream users do not have to unfold its definition.\r\n 5. The lemma `rev_div_assoc` is not necessary but would have had to go in a different file if it were --- we always try to group lemmas in the most appropriate file.\r\n 6. We should not create a global notation `÷` for this very specific situation, especially as it is really just an implementation detail en route to `divSlope_equiv`.\r\n 7. The name `divSlope_equiv` should be camelCase and is too opaque for global namespace.\r\n 8. Part of the reason you have to work so hard here is that the `Projectivization` definition is missing some API. There should be a `Projectivization.lift` definition to help for situations like this.\r\n\r\netc.\r\n\r\nWith all of the above in mind, I propose that you add the following to `LinearAlgebra.Projectivization.Basic` (maybe just above the definition `protected noncomputable def rep`):\r\n```lean\r\n/-- A function on non-zero vectors which is independent of scale, descends to a function on the\r\nprojectivization. -/\r\nprotected def lift {α : Type*} (f : { v : V // v ≠ 0 } → α)\r\n    (hf : ∀ (a b : { v : V // v ≠ 0 }) (t : K), a = t • (b : V) → f a = f b)\r\n    (x : ℙ K V) : α :=\r\n  Quotient.lift f (by rintro ⟨-, hv⟩ ⟨w, hw⟩ ⟨⟨t, -⟩, rfl⟩; exact hf ⟨_, hv⟩ ⟨w, hw⟩ t rfl) x\r\n\r\n@[simp]\r\nprotected lemma lift_mk {α : Type*} (f : { v : V // v ≠ 0 } → α)\r\n    (hf : ∀ (a b : { v : V // v ≠ 0 }) (t : K), a = t • (b : V) → f a = f b)\r\n    (v : V) (hv : v ≠ 0) :\r\n    Projectivization.lift f hf (mk K v hv) = f ⟨v, hv⟩ :=\r\n  rfl\r\n```\r\nand then using that the entire contents of your file can be replaced with:\r\n```lean\r\nopen scoped LinearAlgebra.Projectivization OnePoint\r\nopen Projectivization\r\n\r\nnamespace OnePoint\r\n\r\nvariable (K : Type*) [DivisionRing K] [DecidableEq K]\r\n\r\ndef equivProjectivization :\r\n    OnePoint K ≃ ℙ K (K × K) where\r\n  toFun p := Option.elim p (mk K (1, 0) (by simp)) (fun t ↦ mk K (t, 1) (by simp))\r\n  invFun p := by\r\n    refine Projectivization.lift\r\n      (fun u : {v : K × K // v ≠ 0} ↦ if u.1.2 ≠ 0 then ((u.1.2)⁻¹ * u.1.1) else ∞) ?_ p\r\n    rintro ⟨-, hv⟩ ⟨⟨x, y⟩, hw⟩ t rfl\r\n    have ht : t ≠ 0 := by rintro rfl; simp at hv\r\n    by_cases h₀ : y = 0 <;> simp [h₀, ht, mul_assoc]\r\n  left_inv p := by cases p <;> simp [OnePoint.infty, OnePoint.some]\r\n  right_inv p := by\r\n    induction' p using ind with p hp\r\n    obtain ⟨x, y⟩ := p\r\n    by_cases h₀ : y = 0 <;>\r\n    simp only [Option.elim, ite_not, Projectivization.lift_mk, h₀, mk_eq_mk_iff]\r\n    · have h₀' : x ≠ 0 := by aesop\r\n      exact ⟨Units.mk0 _ (inv_ne_zero h₀'), by simp [h₀']⟩\r\n    · exact ⟨Units.mk0 _ (inv_ne_zero h₀), by simp [h₀]⟩\r\n\r\n@[simp]\r\nlemma equivProjectivization_apply_infinity :\r\n    equivProjectivization K ∞ = mk K ⟨1, 0⟩ (by simp) :=\r\n  rfl\r\n\r\n@[simp]\r\nlemma equivProjectivization_apply_coe (t : K) :\r\n    equivProjectivization K t = mk K ⟨t, 1⟩ (by simp) :=\r\n  rfl\r\n\r\n@[simp]\r\nlemma equivProjectivization_symm_apply_mk (x y : K) (h : (x, y) ≠ 0) :\r\n    (equivProjectivization K).symm (mk K ⟨x, y⟩ h) = if y = 0 then ∞ else y⁻¹ * x := by\r\n  simp [equivProjectivization]\r\n\r\nend OnePoint\r\n```\r\n\r\nThank you again for this work.

For now I just have some passing comments:\r\n\r\n1.  The way I think about this is that if $V$ is a vector space then a choice of codimension-one affine subspace $H$ which does not contain the origin induces a bijection $ℙV \\simeq H ⊔ ℙH$ (according to whether a line in $V$ meets $H$ or not). In the case that $V$ is two-dimensional, this means $H$ is one-dimensional and so $H$ is a line and $ℙH$ is a point. I can't help wondering if we might be able to simplify some of the proofs here by factoring them through this more abstract approach.\r\n2. Notwithstanding the above, I admit it is may be worth giving special attention to situation (currently proposed) where $V$ is the plane and $H$ is the horizontal line through $(0, 1)$.\r\n3. It looks like some of the results require `Field K` where `DivisionRing K` should work? This is not just Mathlib silliness: I think it is important that we can cover the case of the quaternionic projective line.\r\n\r\nAnyway as I say, I'll return at the weekend and give do some proper feedback, and in the meantime, thanks again.",

E.g., I think there is a moderate amount of room for golfing. I also note that various definitions like `divOnePoint` and `divOnePoint'` are really just implementation details en route to `divSlope_equiv` so shouldn't really be exposed. Also everything is in the root namespace and the notation `÷` is global 😱 \r\n\r\n> Generalizing to division rings worked out nicely so thanks for suggesting that.\r\n\r\nGreat, thanks for taking up the suggestion!\r\n\r\n> Regarding your comment (1) above, ℙ V ≃ H ⊔ ℙ H , what is the bijection you have in mind?\r\n\r\nI think we can live without this, but since you mentioned it, I was trying to sketch the bijection with the remark \"according to whether a line in V meets H or not\". The idea is that if `H` is a codimension-one affine plane (with distinguished point acting as origin) inside `V`, then the lines in `V` (i.e., the points of `ℙ V`) fall into two classes: those that intersect `H` and those that do not (i.e., they're parallel to `H`). Each line in the first class is uniquely determined by its point of intersection with `H` and so we can identify this subset of `ℙ V` with `H`. The lines in the second class each uniquely determine a line in `H` by translating the origin of `V` to the distinguished point of `H`. So we can identify these parallel lines with lines in `H`, i.e., with `ℙ H`. So that's the bijection (and the inductive construction of projective space).",

              "body": "> It looks good but I there are a few points I'd like to address. E.g., I think there is a moderate amount of room for golfing. I also note that various definitions like `divOnePoint` and `divOnePoint'` are really just implementation details en route to `divSlope_equiv` so shouldn't really be exposed. Also everything is in the root namespace and the notation `÷` is global 😱\r\n> \r\n\r\nSorry about that, I've put everything except `divSlope_equiv` in a namespace `OnePointEquiv` now. I don't know if that's the proper way.\r\n\r\n> > Regarding your comment (1) above, ℙ V ≃ H ⊔ ℙ H , what is the bijection you have in mind?\r\n> \r\n> I think we can live without this, but since you mentioned it, I was trying to sketch the bijection with the remark \"according to whether a line in V meets H or not\". The idea is that if `H` is a codimension-one affine plane (with distinguished point acting as origin) inside `V`, then the lines in `V` (i.e., the points of `ℙ V`) fall into two classes: those that intersect `H` and those that do not (i.e., they're parallel to `H`). Each line in the first class is uniquely determined by its point of intersection with `H` and so we can identify this subset of `ℙ V` with `H`. The lines in the second class each uniquely determine a line in `H` by translating the origin of `V` to the distinguished point of `H`. So we can identify these parallel lines with lines in `H`, i.e., with `ℙ H`. So that's the bijection (and the inductive construction of projective space).\r\n\r\nAh okay, I see the picture now.\r\nIt would be nice to eventually add a proof that `divSlope` is a homeomorphism in the case of ℝ.\r\nI have completed and formalized such a proof, although I wouldn't say it's Mathlib-level yet.\r\nSo, one question is whether your map also is a homeomorphism.\r\n\r\n\r\n",

              "body": "Thank you very much for taking this up. I have finally had time to take a close look.\r\n\r\nEven though this is very nice work, I have quite a few suggestions. Some of these are just aspects of Mathlib style that there is no way to know in advance. Some detailed high-level remarks are as follows:\r\n 1. Using `open Classical` is almost always undesirable, and is undesirable here. We should use `[DecidableEq K]` instead here. (I will omit the detailed explanation for now, but can provide it upon request.)\r\n 2. Almost all the definitions / lemmas are auxiliary to the main construction with no value once you have `divSlope_equiv`. If possible we should thus avoid creating them.\r\n 3. I think we should use `K × K` instead of `Fin 2 → K` because this is more convenient and the result does not generalise beyond dimension two (more precisely it generalises in a different direction: to spheres, rather than projective spaces).\r\n 4. When authoring a new definition like `divSlope_equiv` we should almost always create API that defines its behaviour so that downstream users do not have to unfold its definition.\r\n 5. The lemma `rev_div_assoc` is not necessary but would have had to go in a different file if it were --- we always try to group lemmas in the most appropriate file.\r\n 6. We should not create a global notation `÷` for this very specific situation, especially as it is really just an implementation detail en route to `divSlope_equiv`.\r\n 7. The name `divSlope_equiv` should be camelCase and is too opaque for global namespace.\r\n 8. Part of the reason you have to work so hard here is that the `Projectivization` definition is missing some API. There should be a `Projectivization.lift` definition to help for situations like this.\r\n\r\netc.\r\n\r\nWith all of the above in mind, I propose that you add the following to `LinearAlgebra.Projectivization.Basic` (maybe just above the definition `protected noncomputable def rep`):\r\n```lean\r\n/-- A function on non-zero vectors which is independent of scale, descends to a function on the\r\nprojectivization. -/\r\nprotected def lift {α : Type*} (f : { v : V // v ≠ 0 } → α)\r\n    (hf : ∀ (a b : { v : V // v ≠ 0 }) (t : K), a = t • (b : V) → f a = f b)\r\n    (x : ℙ K V) : α :=\r\n  Quotient.lift f (by rintro ⟨-, hv⟩ ⟨w, hw⟩ ⟨⟨t, -⟩, rfl⟩; exact hf ⟨_, hv⟩ ⟨w, hw⟩ t rfl) x\r\n\r\n@[simp]\r\nprotected lemma lift_mk {α : Type*} (f : { v : V // v ≠ 0 } → α)\r\n    (hf : ∀ (a b : { v : V // v ≠ 0 }) (t : K), a = t • (b : V) → f a = f b)\r\n    (v : V) (hv : v ≠ 0) :\r\n    Projectivization.lift f hf (mk K v hv) = f ⟨v, hv⟩ :=\r\n  rfl\r\n```\r\nand then using that the entire contents of your file can be replaced with:\r\n```lean\r\nopen scoped LinearAlgebra.Projectivization OnePoint\r\nopen Projectivization\r\n\r\nnamespace OnePoint\r\n\r\nvariable (K : Type*) [DivisionRing K] [DecidableEq K]\r\n\r\ndef equivProjectivization :\r\n    OnePoint K ≃ ℙ K (K × K) where\r\n  toFun p := Option.elim p (mk K (1, 0) (by simp)) (fun t ↦ mk K (t, 1) (by simp))\r\n  invFun p := by\r\n    refine Projectivization.lift\r\n      (fun u : {v : K × K // v ≠ 0} ↦ if u.1.2 ≠ 0 then ((u.1.2)⁻¹ * u.1.1) else ∞) ?_ p\r\n    rintro ⟨-, hv⟩ ⟨⟨x, y⟩, hw⟩ t rfl\r\n    have ht : t ≠ 0 := by rintro rfl; simp at hv\r\n    by_cases h₀ : y = 0 <;> simp [h₀, ht, mul_assoc]\r\n  left_inv p := by cases p <;> simp [OnePoint.infty, OnePoint.some]\r\n  right_inv p := by\r\n    induction' p using ind with p hp\r\n    obtain ⟨x, y⟩ := p\r\n    by_cases h₀ : y = 0 <;>\r\n    simp only [Option.elim, ite_not, Projectivization.lift_mk, h₀, mk_eq_mk_iff]\r\n    · have h₀' : x ≠ 0 := by aesop\r\n      exact ⟨Units.mk0 _ (inv_ne_zero h₀'), by simp [h₀']⟩\r\n    · exact ⟨Units.mk0 _ (inv_ne_zero h₀), by simp [h₀]⟩\r\n\r\n@[simp]\r\nlemma equivProjectivization_apply_infinity :\r\n    equivProjectivization K ∞ = mk K ⟨1, 0⟩ (by simp) :=\r\n  rfl\r\n\r\n@[simp]\r\nlemma equivProjectivization_apply_coe (t : K) :\r\n    equivProjectivization K t = mk K ⟨t, 1⟩ (by simp) :=\r\n  rfl\r\n\r\n@[simp]\r\nlemma equivProjectivization_symm_apply_mk (x y : K) (h : (x, y) ≠ 0) :\r\n    (equivProjectivization K).symm (mk K ⟨x, y⟩ h) = if y = 0 then ∞ else y⁻¹ * x := by\r\n  simp [equivProjectivization]\r\n\r\nend OnePoint\r\n```\r\n\r\nThank you again for this work.

Is this universal property you allude to in Mathlib already?\r\n\r\n`Continuous.homeoOfEquivCompactToT2` is certainly relevant but it's not what I had in mind. I decided to write a reply [on Zulip](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/channel/287929-mathlib4/topic/Projective.20extended.20real.20line/near/479252033) for greater visibility. Hopefully I got it correct!",
