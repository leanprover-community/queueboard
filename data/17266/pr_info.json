For now I just have some passing comments:\r\n\r\n1.  The way I think about this is that if $V$ is a vector space then a choice of codimension-one affine subspace $H$ which does not contain the origin induces a bijection $ℙV \\simeq H ⊔ ℙH$ (according to whether a line in $V$ meets $H$ or not). In the case that $V$ is two-dimensional, this means $H$ is one-dimensional and so $H$ is a line and $ℙH$ is a point. I can't help wondering if we might be able to simplify some of the proofs here by factoring them through this more abstract approach.\r\n2. Notwithstanding the above, I admit it is may be worth giving special attention to situation (currently proposed) where $V$ is the plane and $H$ is the horizontal line through $(0, 1)$.\r\n3. It looks like some of the results require `Field K` where `DivisionRing K` should work? This is not just Mathlib silliness: I think it is important that we can cover the case of the quaternionic projective line.\r\n\r\nAnyway as I say, I'll return at the weekend and give do some proper feedback, and in the meantime, thanks again.",

For now I just have some passing comments:\r\n\r\n1.  The way I think about this is that if $V$ is a vector space then a choice of codimension-one affine subspace $H$ which does not contain the origin induces a bijection $ℙV \\simeq H ⊔ ℙH$ (according to whether a line in $V$ meets $H$ or not). In the case that $V$ is two-dimensional, this means $H$ is one-dimensional and so $H$ is a line and $ℙH$ is a point. I can't help wondering if we might be able to simplify some of the proofs here by factoring them through this more abstract approach.\r\n2. Notwithstanding the above, I admit it is may be worth giving special attention to situation (currently proposed) where $V$ is the plane and $H$ is the horizontal line through $(0, 1)$.\r\n3. It looks like some of the results require `Field K` where `DivisionRing K` should work? This is not just Mathlib silliness: I think it is important that we can cover the case of the quaternionic projective line.\r\n\r\nAnyway as I say, I'll return at the weekend and give do some proper feedback, and in the meantime, thanks again.",
