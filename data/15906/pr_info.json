              "body": "Thanks for the review! I agree that not everything is self-explanatory; let me expand on the background.\r\n\r\nAbout bordisms: the first time I heard about cobordisms, it was the definition you mentioned. The general definition involves an additional map: two singular n-manifolds (M,f:M\\to X) and (N,g:N\\to X) are cobordant if there's a cobordism between them --- which is a compact (n+1)-manifold W together with a map F\\to X such that\r\n- the boundary of W is diffeomorphic to the disjoint union of M and N, and\r\n- under this diffeomorphism, the map F restricts to f resp. g.\r\n\r\nIn particular, if X is a one-point space, one arrives at the definition you give.\r\n\r\n**References.** I learned this from my advisor's course (see [these notes](https://www.mathematik.hu-berlin.de/~wendl/Sommer2024/Topologie3/comments.pdf), week 14). I'm just formalising parts of the first page... as formalisation takes more time and space so far.\r\nDan Freed's lecture notes (https://web.ma.utexas.edu/users/dafr/bordism.pdf) are also supposed to be pretty good.\r\nThe manifold atlas page http://www.map.mpim-bonn.mpg.de/B-Bordism#Piecewise_linear_and_topological_bordism has much more generality. Mathlib is not ready for that yet, not even close.\r\n\r\n**Bigger picture for this PR**. As Yael mentioned, [this branch](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/compare/master...MR-bordism-theory) has my overall work so far, leading up to defining the unoriented bordism groups. At the end, I realised I needed to change the design of singular n-manifolds (to the current one); I haven't gone through and adapted all of that branch yet. When I do, it shouldn't be too hard to prover that the unordered bordism group is a group.\r\nThere are a number of sorries, most of which are missing pre-requisites like \"the disjoint union of two n-dimensional manifolds is an n-manifold\". Doable, should be in mathlib, but someone needs to do it. (And I'm supposed to work on e.g. the Carleson project now.)",

Medium-term, we'd like to perform two constructions with singular n-manifolds: take the direct sum (to define bordism groups), and take the product (for the bordism *ring*).\r\nTaking products means we'll have to take ModelProd as a model space, and using R^n and R^m becomes painful to impossible to use here: we *have* to do something else. On the other hand, the direct sum construction requires *the same* model space for now. However, that step is more flexible: if we have an equivalence of the model to a common model, we can translate the charted space structures are still reach our goal.\r\nThis yields the eventual definition I chose: model singular n-manifolds on some space H, but keep a homeomorphism to R^n around (which is used for the direct sum).\r\n\r\n- I am not sure about the universes: the checkUnivs linter still complains if I change them as you say.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are three sorries remaining, but none of them is mathematically problematic (nor interesting).",

(For me, a cobordism between two manifolds M and N is a manifold one dimension higher with two boundary components which are diffeomorphic to M and N respectively, but I don't see how your singular manifolds fit into this picture). Either in the file-level docstring, or in the PR, as you prefer.\r\n\r\nI think it would help me a lot to see a theorem which is proved with this formalism (the proof of the pudding is in the eating). Do you have a working branch with a specific theorem you could point me to, so that I get a better grasp of where you want to go? (Ideally you could even open a PR with a work in progress branch, for easier discussion there)",

Also explain that, for `X = a point`, you just get manifolds in the usual sense. And maybe sketch an example of something that can be done with this formalism but which can not be done using manifolds in the usual sense?\r\n\r\nNote that wikipedia, for instance, only defines bordism in the usual sense (where two manifolds are cobordant if they are the boundaries of a one-dimensional higher manifold), so it's a little bit surprising to say that you are doing \"the beginnings of bordism\" and go directly to a slightly exotic setting. So I think this deserves big warnings, and motivation in the docstring. ",

One you fix `I`, you are fixing the model space, so by definition `s` and `t` have the same model space, and there is nothing special to do: just use `I` also for the disjoint union. On the other hand, it makes me realize that the parameter `n` is completely useless in all the story, as it is also determined by `I` (it's the dimension of the target space of `I`). So why not just remove it completely from the definition of `SingularNManifold` (and from the whole file)?",

              "body": "Thanks for the review! I agree that not everything is self-explanatory; let me expand on the background.\r\n\r\nAbout bordisms: the first time I heard about cobordisms, it was the definition you mentioned. The general definition involves an additional map: two singular n-manifolds (M,f:M\\to X) and (N,g:N\\to X) are cobordant if there's a cobordism between them --- which is a compact (n+1)-manifold W together with a map F\\to X such that\r\n- the boundary of W is diffeomorphic to the disjoint union of M and N, and\r\n- under this diffeomorphism, the map F restricts to f resp. g.\r\n\r\nIn particular, if X is a one-point space, one arrives at the definition you give.\r\n\r\n**References.** I learned this from my advisor's course (see [these notes](https://www.mathematik.hu-berlin.de/~wendl/Sommer2024/Topologie3/comments.pdf), week 14). I'm just formalising parts of the first page... as formalisation takes more time and space so far.\r\nDan Freed's lecture notes (https://web.ma.utexas.edu/users/dafr/bordism.pdf) are also supposed to be pretty good.\r\nThe manifold atlas page http://www.map.mpim-bonn.mpg.de/B-Bordism#Piecewise_linear_and_topological_bordism has much more generality. Mathlib is not ready for that yet, not even close.\r\n\r\n**Bigger picture for this PR**. As Yael mentioned, [this branch](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/compare/master...MR-bordism-theory) has my overall work so far, leading up to defining the unoriented bordism groups. At the end, I realised I needed to change the design of singular n-manifolds (to the current one); I haven't gone through and adapted all of that branch yet. When I do, it shouldn't be too hard to prover that the unordered bordism group is a group.\r\nThere are a number of sorries, most of which are missing pre-requisites like \"the disjoint union of two n-dimensional manifolds is an n-manifold\". Doable, should be in mathlib, but someone needs to do it. (And I'm supposed to work on e.g. the Carleson project now.)",

Medium-term, we'd like to perform two constructions with singular n-manifolds: take the direct sum (to define bordism groups), and take the product (for the bordism *ring*).\r\nTaking products means we'll have to take ModelProd as a model space, and using R^n and R^m becomes painful to impossible to use here: we *have* to do something else. On the other hand, the direct sum construction requires *the same* model space for now. However, that step is more flexible: if we have an equivalence of the model to a common model, we can translate the charted space structures are still reach our goal.\r\nThis yields the eventual definition I chose: model singular n-manifolds on some space H, but keep a homeomorphism to R^n around (which is used for the direct sum).\r\n\r\n- I am not sure about the universes: the checkUnivs linter still complains if I change them as you say.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are three sorries remaining, but none of them is mathematically problematic (nor interesting).",
