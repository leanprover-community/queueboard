Even better, as soon as this one is merged, when you will update master on #16978, this will import these new lemmas there, so there will be no need to add them manually. All in all, a certain def/lemma should appear in a PR only if\r\n1. You are trying to add it to master \r\n2. You need it for the other results of that PR.",
