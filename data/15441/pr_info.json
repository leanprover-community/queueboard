Or you can define a local notation for `UnitAddCircle.toCircle` (or the bundled version `toCircle_addChar`) and shorten things further (analogous to the use of `𝐞` in the Fourier-transform theory over the reals).\r\n\r\n> (or `dft f : (G →+ UnitAddCircle) →+ UnitAddCircle` at `g : G →+ UnitAddCircle` to get `dft f g : ℂ`\r\n\r\nI don't think you mean this, because `dft f` won't take values in any kind of circle. But if we let `𝐞` be notation for `UnitAddCircle.toCircle`, you can define `dft f` to be the function sending `h : G →+ UnitAddCircle` to `∑ g : G, 𝐞 (h g) • f g`, with optional signs and/or factors of `G.card` according to taste.\r\n\r\n",

Or you can define a local notation for `UnitAddCircle.toCircle` (or the bundled version `toCircle_addChar`) and shorten things further (analogous to the use of `𝐞` in the Fourier-transform theory over the reals).\r\n\r\n> (or `dft f : (G →+ UnitAddCircle) →+ UnitAddCircle` at `g : G →+ UnitAddCircle` to get `dft f g : ℂ`\r\n\r\nI don't think you mean this, because `dft f` won't take values in any kind of circle. But if we let `𝐞` be notation for `UnitAddCircle.toCircle`, you can define `dft f` to be the function sending `h : G →+ UnitAddCircle` to `∑ g : G, 𝐞 (h g) • f g`, with optional signs and/or factors of `G.card` according to taste.\r\n\r\n",
