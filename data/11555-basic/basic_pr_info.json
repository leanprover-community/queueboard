We assume that `α` is a sheafification map (i.e. it is both locally injective and locally surjective) . Let `M₀` be a presheaf of modules over `R₀`. Let `A` be the associated sheaf of the underlying presheaf of abelian groups of `M₀`. Then, it is shown in this PR that there is a canonical structure of sheaf of `R`-modules on `A`.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n- [x] depends on: #6845\r\n- [x] depends on: #11479\r\n- [x] depends on: #13324\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- The text above the `---` will become the commit message when your\r\nPR is merged.

The design I have followed is meant to facilitate some future developments. That the sheafification functor #13441 composed with the forget functor to sheaves of abelian groups is definitionally the sheafification of the underlying presheaf is also helpful. It is quite a pedestrian approach, but it has some benefits!",
