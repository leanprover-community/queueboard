Your results use gcd properties, hence are more number theoretic in flavor.\n\nYou could put them in `Algebra.GroupWithZero.Power` because that file has overinflated imports due to importing `Algebra.GroupPower.Lemmas` which is a mess of imports.\n\nI noticed it when I merged master in #9411, since your proof was suddenly missing imports. I added the `assert_not_exists Set.range` clause which is already effective in most of the algebraic hierarchy and tried to add imports back to make your proofs compile, but that wasn't possible since your last statement mentions `Set.range`.\n\nI also do not exclude removing `Algebra.GroupWithZero.Power` eventually, since it's already supposed to be covered by the files in `Algebra.GroupPower`.",

Your results use gcd properties, hence are more number theoretic in flavor.\n\nYou could put them in `Algebra.GroupWithZero.Power` because that file has overinflated imports due to importing `Algebra.GroupPower.Lemmas` which is a mess of imports.\n\nI noticed it when I merged master in #9411, since your proof was suddenly missing imports. I added the `assert_not_exists Set.range` clause which is already effective in most of the algebraic hierarchy and tried to add imports back to make your proofs compile, but that wasn't possible since your last statement mentions `Set.range`.\n\nI also do not exclude removing `Algebra.GroupWithZero.Power` eventually, since it's already supposed to be covered by the files in `Algebra.GroupPower`.",
