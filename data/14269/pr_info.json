It *told* you to run `lake exe mk_all` locally; that would indeed have fixed the error. (Though with your current workflow of not cloning mathlib and avoiding git, that's perhaps a difficult change to make.)\r\n\r\nNow, I agree that all three error messages together paint a very confusing picture, and that perhaps this is not obvious.\r\nPerhaps the error message is misleading - if there's a way to phrase this that is less confusing, I would be very interested in hearing about it. I *tried* to make it clear, but I am biased since I already know where the error is.",

(Note that in theorems whose conclusion is an \"iff\" statement, it's usual to have variables implicit if they can be inferred from both sides of the \"iff\", which is the case for your lemma `not_pseudoperfect_iff_forall` for example.)",

It *told* you to run `lake exe mk_all` locally; that would indeed have fixed the error. (Though with your current workflow of not cloning mathlib and avoiding git, that's perhaps a difficult change to make.)\r\n\r\nNow, I agree that all three error messages together paint a very confusing picture, and that perhaps this is not obvious.\r\nPerhaps the error message is misleading - if there's a way to phrase this that is less confusing, I would be very interested in hearing about it. I *tried* to make it clear, but I am biased since I already know where the error is.",
