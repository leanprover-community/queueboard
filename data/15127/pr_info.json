You can't pass a proof of congruence to it because it takes in a `(h : ((· ≈ ·) ⇒ (· ≈ ·)) f f)` instead of something of type `: (h : ∀ a b, a ≈ b → f a = f b)` or its generalization `(h : ∀ x y, R x y → S (f x) (f y))`, which is why I used this lemmas.\r\n\r\nMaybe the reasonable thing instead would be defining a  `map'` that takes in an `(h : ∀ x y, R x y → S (f x) (f y))`, and similarly for `map₂`?

You can't pass a proof of congruence to it because it takes in a `(h : ((· ≈ ·) ⇒ (· ≈ ·)) f f)` instead of something of type `: (h : ∀ a b, a ≈ b → f a = f b)` or its generalization `(h : ∀ x y, R x y → S (f x) (f y))`, which is why I used this lemmas.\r\n\r\nMaybe the reasonable thing instead would be defining a  `map'` that takes in an `(h : ∀ x y, R x y → S (f x) (f y))`, and similarly for `map₂`?
