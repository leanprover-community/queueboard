In that papers, most of the details are omitted. I am trying to see if the proofs are more or less the same. As the changes in this case are minimum (just some results true for CommRing are not true for CommSemiring), I thought it would be nice to have it in mathlib4. The change in the  AlgebraicGeometry.Properties is due to what it seems some inference (?) did not work. ",

In that papers, most of the details are omitted. I am trying to see if the proofs are more or less the same. As the changes in this case are minimum (just some results true for CommRing are not true for CommSemiring), I thought it would be nice to have it in mathlib4. The change in the  AlgebraicGeometry.Properties is due to what it seems some inference (?) did not work. ",
