The thing is that I am generally lazy and I don't always read all `variable` declarations above the new def/lemma/theorem I am adding. What I usually do in practice is that I copypaste the header of a similar def/lemma/theorem in the same section and edit it. As a result, if the present def/lemma/theorem redundantly redeclares some variables, I also end up redundantly redeclaring them without any intention to deviate from the default ordering of implicit arguments, which is embarrassing and propagates bad coding habits.",

However, I think they should still be possible, and I generally agree to not repeat arguments from variable unless there is a reason to do so. (imo it introduces confusion and inconsistency about the order of arguments)\r\n\r\nIt's not only review effort that this imposes. Changing argument order also has the potential to disrupt downstream uses of these lemmas. When there is little harm to the current order, and it isn't part of a large refactor that uniformizes this kind of thing across some large subset of Mathlib according to well-defined rules, then I don't really think there is much benefit compared to the cost.\r\n\r\nBut like I said, I won't object to this being merged.

Currently, even after the changes it looks to me like there are still plenty of statements in the file which redeclare implicit variables defined on top.\r\n- It would be helpful if the author of a cleanup PR like this could clearly present some test/checks done to convince the reviewer/maintainer team that the reordering of arguments is deliberate and unharmful. While I agree with the opinion that \"it is probably fine and did not look deliberate in the first place\", it seems not to satisfy the maintainer/review team in general.\r\n\r\nI'm sorry for the troubles Martin, and we hope to see many more of your contributions in the future!\r\n\r\n(feel free to reopen if you strongly care about this PR and would like to address the two points above!)\r\n\r\n",

The thing is that I am generally lazy and I don't always read all `variable` declarations above the new def/lemma/theorem I am adding. What I usually do in practice is that I copypaste the header of a similar def/lemma/theorem in the same section and edit it. As a result, if the present def/lemma/theorem redundantly redeclares some variables, I also end up redundantly redeclaring them without any intention to deviate from the default ordering of implicit arguments, which is embarrassing and propagates bad coding habits.",

              "body": "After the opinions expressed here and also a discussion on Zulip, I think I'm inclined suggesting to reject this PR with the following suggestions:\r\n\r\n- It would be good if a PR like this would cleanup the entire file `Mathlib.Data.Set.Basic` in one go (or in a series of dependent PRs if easier to review in stages). Currently, even after the changes it looks to me like there are still plenty of statements in the file which redeclare implicit variables defined on top.\r\n- It would be helpful if the author of a cleanup PR like this could clearly present some test/checks done to convince the reviewer/maintainer team that the reordering of arguments is deliberate and unharmful. While I agree with the opinion that \"it is probably fine and did not look deliberate in the first place\", it seems not to satisfy the maintainer/review team in general.\r\n\r\nI'm sorry for the troubles Martin, and we hope to see many more of your contributions in the future!\r\n\r\n(feel free to reopen if you strongly care about this PR and would like to address the two points above!)\r\n\r\n",
