What is the motivation for doing it that way, rather than just choosing one type of coordinates?\r\n\r\nI need Jacobian coordinates, because their coordinates are precisely the division polynomials in #6703 and the phi_n/omega_n defined in AEC Exercise III.3.7, [albeit with an error](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/4675977/division-polynomials-in-characteristic-two). I don't need projective coordinates at the moment, but I believe it might be a very useful definition in general (e.g. to give an elementary definition of reduction modulo p without any bias on the weights). In fact projective coordinates was my toy model for Jacobian coordinates because originally I wasn't sure how to write the API at all.",

It's equally valid in the m=n case, and although it's just a lemma towards the main theorem it could be useful elsewhere.\r\n\r\nThe generalization of scalar multiplication on `Fin 3 → R` from `Rˣ` to `R` is for the same purpose; it would be ugly to use `Units.mk0`, which still won't cover the m=n case.

What is the motivation for doing it that way, rather than just choosing one type of coordinates?\r\n\r\nI need Jacobian coordinates, because their coordinates are precisely the division polynomials in #6703 and the phi_n/omega_n defined in AEC Exercise III.3.7, [albeit with an error](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/4675977/division-polynomials-in-characteristic-two). I don't need projective coordinates at the moment, but I believe it might be a very useful definition in general (e.g. to give an elementary definition of reduction modulo p without any bias on the weights). In fact projective coordinates was my toy model for Jacobian coordinates because originally I wasn't sure how to write the API at all.",

It's equally valid in the m=n case, and although it's just a lemma towards the main theorem it could be useful elsewhere.\r\n\r\nThe generalization of scalar multiplication on `Fin 3 → R` from `Rˣ` to `R` is for the same purpose; it would be ugly to use `Units.mk0`, which still won't cover the m=n case. Although the case n=m+1 suffices for the main theorem, it's nicer to state and prove the general case.",
