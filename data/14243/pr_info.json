The current version proves everything with `wronskian`, and now we are trying to prove them using the lemma `eq_of_add_add_eq_zero` for alternating forms. So I tried to prove everything on the level of `wronskianBilin` instead of `wronskian`, and then use `rw` to rewrite every current lemma with `wronskianBilin`. For example, my unpushed proof includes something like\r\n```lean\r\ntheorem wronskian_neg_right (a b : R[X]) : wronskian a (-b) = -wronskian a b := by\r\n  rw [←wronskianBilin_apply, ←wronskianBilin_apply]; exact (wronskianBilin R a).map_neg b\r\n\r\ntheorem wronskian_eq_of_sum_zero {a b c : R[X]} (hAdd : a + b + c = 0) :\r\n    wronskian a b = wronskian b c := by\r\n  have h : wronskianBilin R a b = wronskianBilin R b c :=\r\n    by exact LinearMap.IsAlt.eq_of_add_add_eq_zero IsAltwronskianBilin hAdd\r\n  rw [←wronskianBilin_apply, ←wronskianBilin_apply]; exact h\r\n```\r\nSo we utilizes the fact that `wronskianBilin` is indeed a bilinear map and reuse theorems there. But if we prove `IsAltwronskianBilin` with `wronskian` + ring tactics through `wronskianBilin_apply`, I felt like I'm doing in a reverse way. ",

But I have an (unordinary) application in my mind that uses n-ary Wronskian. The polynomial FLT can be extended to arbitrary number of polynomials as follows: for any algebraically closed characteristic zero field $k$, the Fermat-Catalan equation\r\n\r\n$$\r\na_{1}^{m_{1}} + a_{2}^{m_{2}} + \\cdots + a_{n-1}^{m_{n-1}} = a_{n}^{m_{n}}\r\n$$\r\n\r\ndoes not admit a non-constant solution in $k[t]$ whenever $n(n-2) \\leq m_{i}$ for all $1\\leq i \\leq n$ (see [this](https://staff.math.su.se/shapiro/ProblemSolving/BayatTeimoori.pdf) paper). The proof is almost same as the original Mason-Stothers theorem, and it certainly uses n-ary Wronskian. I haven't tried to formalize this proof yet, but if someone wants to formalize this (or possibly more general version that is much close to the Mason-Stothers theorem, not only for the Fermat-Catalan equations), they may need the n-ary version.\r\n\r\nBut Wronskian itself is more useful for testing linear independence of sufficiently nice functions, not only polynomials. In that direction, ultimately it would be better to define Wronskian for more general class of functions - or even for abstract rings with derivations - not only for polynomials. So I think it is fine to leave it as-is at this point.",

The current version proves everything with `wronskian`, and now we are trying to prove them using the lemma `eq_of_add_add_eq_zero` for alternating forms. So I tried to prove everything on the level of `wronskianBilin` instead of `wronskian`, and then use `rw` to rewrite every current lemma with `wronskianBilin`. For example, my unpushed proof includes something like\r\n```lean\r\ntheorem wronskian_neg_right (a b : R[X]) : wronskian a (-b) = -wronskian a b := by\r\n  rw [←wronskianBilin_apply, ←wronskianBilin_apply]; exact (wronskianBilin R a).map_neg b\r\n\r\ntheorem wronskian_eq_of_sum_zero {a b c : R[X]} (hAdd : a + b + c = 0) :\r\n    wronskian a b = wronskian b c := by\r\n  have h : wronskianBilin R a b = wronskianBilin R b c :=\r\n    by exact LinearMap.IsAlt.eq_of_add_add_eq_zero IsAltwronskianBilin hAdd\r\n  rw [←wronskianBilin_apply, ←wronskianBilin_apply]; exact h\r\n```\r\nSo we utilizes the fact that `wronskianBilin` is indeed a bilinear map and reuse theorems there. But if we prove `IsAltwronskianBilin` with `wronskian` + ring tactics through `wronskianBilin_apply`, I felt like I'm doing in a reverse way. ",

But I have an (unordinary) application in my mind that uses n-ary Wronskian. The polynomial FLT can be extended to arbitrary number of polynomials as follows: for any algebraically closed characteristic zero field $k$, the Fermat-Catalan equation\r\n\r\n$$\r\na_{1}^{m_{1}} + a_{2}^{m_{2}} + \\cdots + a_{n-1}^{m_{n-1}} = a_{n}^{m_{n}}\r\n$$\r\n\r\ndoes not admit a non-constant solution in $k[t]$ whenever $n(n-2) \\leq m_{i}$ for all $1\\leq i \\leq n$ (see [this](https://staff.math.su.se/shapiro/ProblemSolving/BayatTeimoori.pdf) paper). The proof is almost same as the original Mason-Stothers theorem, and it certainly uses n-ary Wronskian. I haven't tried to formalize this proof yet, but if someone wants to formalize this (or possibly more general version that is much close to the Mason-Stothers theorem, not only for the Fermat-Catalan equations), they may need the n-ary version.\r\n\r\nBut Wronskian itself is more useful for testing linear independence of sufficiently nice functions, not only polynomials. In that direction, ultimately it would be better to define Wronskian for more general class of functions - or even for abstract rings with derivations - not only for polynomials. So I think it is fine to leave it as-is at this point.",
