I adapted the file to talk about modules.\r\n\r\nThe only subtlety is that, to check this does indeed give the same thing for non-commutative rings, one needs to start from a basis of left ideals and one of right ideals to build one made of two-sided ideals, which needs a slight trick. I can move this part to a later PR if needed, but I think it also fits here.",

I adapted the file to talk about modules.\r\n\r\nThe only subtlety is that, to check this does indeed give the same thing for non-commutative rings, one needs to start from a basis of left ideals and one of right ideals to build one made of two-sided ideals, which needs a slight trick. I can move this part to a later PR if needed, but I think it also fits here.",
