These two `sorry` are used to show that `Algebra.adjoin k {a}` (`k(a)` in the notation of the blog) is purely separable over `k`. The difficulties here are to prove `k(a)` is integral over `k`, and resolve the image of `algebraMap`.\r\n> \r\n> I don't think you need to tackle `Algebra.adjoin` things here, since they are already solved in separable/purely inseparable APIs. You may start with the following code:\r\n> \r\n> ```lean\r\n> import Mathlib.FieldTheory.PurelyInseparable\r\n> \r\n> open LinearMap in\r\n> theorem test1\r\n>     {k D : Type*} [Field k] [DivisionRing D] [Algebra k D] [Algebra.IsAlgebraic k D]\r\n>     (hcenter : Subalgebra.center k D = ⊥)\r\n>     (hneq : (⊥ : Subalgebra k D) ≠ ⊤) :\r\n>     ∃ x : D, x ∉ (⊥ : Subalgebra k D) ∧ IsSeparable k x := by\r\n>   classical\r\n>   obtain ⟨q, _⟩ := ExpChar.exists k\r\n>   by_contra! H\r\n>   have h1 : IsPurelyInseparable k D :=\r\n>     ⟨Algebra.IsAlgebraic.isIntegral, fun x ↦ not_imp_not.1 (H x)⟩\r\n>   rw [isPurelyInseparable_iff_pow_mem k q] at h1\r\n>   sorry\r\n> ```\r\n> \r\n> First you can conclude `IsPurelyInseparable k D` just from the definition of purely inseparable in mathlib. Then you use `isPurelyInseparable_iff_pow_mem` to conclude that every element of `D` can be powered into `k`.\r\n\r\nIndeed, I can bypass `Algebra.adjoin`, thanks! I've finished migration of the first statement, and will try out the second statement.",

How can I solve these?\r\n\r\n(the commit seems messy now, but once the instance is fixed, we can remove condition `hl` in `IsSeparable.of_equiv_equiv₀`, `he` in `IsSeparable.of_equiv` (this will then close our original problem of translating statements), and `hc` in `IsSeparable.of_equiv_equiv''`.

These two `sorry` are used to show that `Algebra.adjoin k {a}` (`k(a)` in the notation of the blog) is purely separable over `k`. The difficulties here are to prove `k(a)` is integral over `k`, and resolve the image of `algebraMap`.~~ Plus, I noticed that the new instance in LinearMaps seems to be slow.",

Do you think it still worth keeping?\r\n> \r\n> Well, why not?\r\n\r\nI was thinking that, it seems possible to deduce similar result via `charP_of_injective_ringHom`. For instance, we can define map `R → (M →ₗ[R] M)` as `r ↦ (fun (x : M) ↦ r • x)`. If this map is injective, then we are done. \r\nAnd its injectivity is equivalent to `∀ x : M, ∀ r : R, r • x = 0 → r = 0`, which is slightly more strict than `hreduction : ∃ x : M, ∀ r : R, r • x = 0 → r = 0`. Plus, one might also need `R` to be a ring to prove injectivity. Hence, I think that `char_eq_if` could be more general (and its proof shorter), but I'm not sure if it is significant enough to be in mathlib.",

              "body": "> There is API for purely inseparable extension (unfortunately, only for commutative rings). Would you consider using it (after extend it to non-commutative case)?\r\n\r\nI think indeed we've tried using [isPurelyInseparable_iff_pow_mem](https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/Mathlib/FieldTheory/PurelyInseparable.html#isPurelyInseparable_iff_pow_mem) for Fact 2 in the blog. But like you said, we need to either extend purely inseparable to non-commutative case or figure out how to define `k(\\alpha)` in the notation of that blog (the difficulty here is that `IntermediateField.adjoin` demands a field over `k(\\alpha)`, which isn't easy to find). This is surely an interesting idea.",

Would you consider using it (after extend it to non-commutative case)?\r\n> > \r\n> > \r\n> > I think indeed we've tried using [isPurelyInseparable_iff_pow_mem](https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/Mathlib/FieldTheory/PurelyInseparable.html#isPurelyInseparable_iff_pow_mem) for Fact 2 in the blog. But like you said, we need to either extend purely inseparable to non-commutative case or figure out how to define `k(\\alpha)` in the notation of that blog (the difficulty here is that `IntermediateField.adjoin` demands a field over `k(\\alpha)`, which isn't easy to find). This is surely an interesting idea.\r\n> \r\n> The newest version of mathlib supports purely inseparable for non-commutative rings. You can try it out.\r\n\r\nThanks for the PR! I've already merged recent master into this branch. We'll look into it.",
