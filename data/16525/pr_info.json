These two `sorry` are used to show that `Algebra.adjoin k {a}` (`k(a)` in the notation of the blog) is purely separable over `k`. The difficulties here are to prove `k(a)` is integral over `k`, and resolve the image of `algebraMap`.\r\n> \r\n> I don't think you need to tackle `Algebra.adjoin` things here, since they are already solved in separable/purely inseparable APIs. You may start with the following code:\r\n> \r\n> ```lean\r\n> import Mathlib.FieldTheory.PurelyInseparable\r\n> \r\n> open LinearMap in\r\n> theorem test1\r\n>     {k D : Type*} [Field k] [DivisionRing D] [Algebra k D] [Algebra.IsAlgebraic k D]\r\n>     (hcenter : Subalgebra.center k D = ⊥)\r\n>     (hneq : (⊥ : Subalgebra k D) ≠ ⊤) :\r\n>     ∃ x : D, x ∉ (⊥ : Subalgebra k D) ∧ IsSeparable k x := by\r\n>   classical\r\n>   obtain ⟨q, _⟩ := ExpChar.exists k\r\n>   by_contra! H\r\n>   have h1 : IsPurelyInseparable k D :=\r\n>     ⟨Algebra.IsAlgebraic.isIntegral, fun x ↦ not_imp_not.1 (H x)⟩\r\n>   rw [isPurelyInseparable_iff_pow_mem k q] at h1\r\n>   sorry\r\n> ```\r\n> \r\n> First you can conclude `IsPurelyInseparable k D` just from the definition of purely inseparable in mathlib. Then you use `isPurelyInseparable_iff_pow_mem` to conclude that every element of `D` can be powered into `k`.\r\n\r\nIndeed, I can bypass `Algebra.adjoin`, thanks! I've finished migration of the first statement, and will try out the second statement.",

Soc, 5 (1973), 312-314.) but this is not implemented in mathlb, asaik.\r\n\r\n~~Ahh.... Sorry, I changed it in commit [1ee53e1](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/16525/commits/1ee53e14a238112555fa01937f0a769a40c608b3), line 142, but it somehow got reverted, might be a git error. I'll change that again.~~\r\nOh I just noticed that ```h_exist``` is also a \">\", I'll check again for other greater-than sign.\r\nRegarding the f.d. and algebraic, thanks for the correction!\r\n",

By such, `JacobsonNoether_charZero` and `JacobsonNoether_charP` are unified. \r\n~~However, I wasn't able to fill in the two `sorry` in `temp_exists_pow_mem_center_ofInseparable`, line 209. These two `sorry` are used to show that `Algebra.adjoin k {a}` (`k(a)` in the notation of the blog) is purely separable over `k`. The difficulties here are to prove `k(a)` is integral over `k`, and resolve the image of `algebraMap`.~~ Plus, I noticed that the new instance in LinearMaps seems to be slow.",

Do you think it still worth keeping?\r\n> \r\n> Well, why not?\r\n\r\nI was thinking that, it seems possible to deduce similar result via `charP_of_injective_ringHom`. For instance, we can define map `R → (M →ₗ[R] M)` as `r ↦ (fun (x : M) ↦ r • x)`. If this map is injective, then we are done. \r\nAnd its injectivity is equivalent to `∀ x : M, ∀ r : R, r • x = 0 → r = 0`, which is slightly more strict than `hreduction : ∃ x : M, ∀ r : R, r • x = 0 → r = 0`. Plus, one might also need `R` to be a ring to prove injectivity. Hence, I think that `char_eq_if` could be more general (and its proof shorter), but I'm not sure if it is significant enough to be in mathlib.",

Would you consider using it (after extend it to non-commutative case)?\r\n\r\nI think indeed we've tried using [isPurelyInseparable_iff_pow_mem](https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/Mathlib/FieldTheory/PurelyInseparable.html#isPurelyInseparable_iff_pow_mem) for Fact 2 in the blog. But like you said, we need to either extend purely inseparable to non-commutative case or figure out how to define `k(\\alpha)` in the notation of that blog (the difficulty here is that `IntermediateField.adjoin` demands a field over `k(\\alpha)`, which isn't easy to find). This is surely an interesting idea.",

The first question is that I want to have an instance `Algebra A₂ B₁` in line 200, but if I switch `def` to `instance`, it immediately yields error `cannot find synthesization order for instance @instAlgebra`. ~~The second is that I want `IsSeparable.of_equiv_equiv'` and `IsSeparable.of_equiv_equiv''` to use variables like `A₁ B₁ A₂ B₂` defined at the beginning of the namespace, but once I omit them in the statement, the infer system seems to be confused~~. How can I solve these?\r\n\r\n(the commit seems messy now, but once the instance is fixed, we can remove condition `hl` in `IsSeparable.of_equiv_equiv₀`, `he` in `IsSeparable.of_equiv` (this will then close our original problem of translating statements), and `hc` in `IsSeparable.of_equiv_equiv''`.
