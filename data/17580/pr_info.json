I found another couple of small opportunities for improvement.\r\n\r\nAs perhaps my biggest comment: this changes the dupNamespace linter, to also catch additivised (and other) declarations. Can you extend the PR description to mention this? (This PR could even be split in two, one for the refactoring and one for the new linter. I don't think that is necessary.)\r\nOh, and while you're at it, please also explain what this linter does in the description I just saw that is also missing :-)",

I found another couple of small opportunities for improvement.\r\n\r\nAs perhaps my biggest comment: this changes the dupNamespace linter, to also catch additivised (and other) declarations. Can you extend the PR description to mention this? (This PR could even be split in two, one for the refactoring and one for the new linter. I don't think that is necessary.)\r\nOh, and while you're at it, please also explain what this linter does in the description I just saw that is also missing :-)",
