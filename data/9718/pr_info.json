        "body": "This does a few things:\r\n- Define the algebra morphism `TrivSqZeroExt.map f` between trivial square-zero extensions induced by a linear map`f`, and establish some of its basic properties (functoriality, composition with the basic maps to/from `TrivSqZeroExt`). Note that we only consider the case of a commutative base ring, because the case of a general base ring requires morphisms of bimodules, which we do not have.\r\n- Define the algebra morphism `ExteriorAlgebra.map f` between exterior algebras induced by a linear map `f`. This is a straightforward application of the similar construction for Clifford algebras, but I think it is still useful to have. Basic properties of this construction are proved: functoriality, composition with `ExteriorAlgebra.ι`, `ExteriorAlgebra.ιInv` (this part uses the first point) and `ExteriorAlgebra.ιMulti`. Then exactness properties of the construction is studied:\r\n  - If the linear map is surjective, then the map on exterior algebras is also surjective. This actually holds for Clifford algebras, so I added a lemma called `CliffordAlgebra.map_surjective` in `LinearAlgebra/CliffordAlgebra/Basic.lean`. For exterior algebras, the converse holds and is also proved.\r\n  - If the linear map has a retraction, then the map on exterior algebras is injective. So if the base ring is a field, the map on exterior algebras is injective if the linear map is injective.\r\n\r\n- Establish some properties of `ExteriorAlgebra.ιMulti`:\r\n  - `ExteriorAlgebra.ιMulti_range`: The range of `ιMulti R n` is contained in the `n`th exterior power (define here as `LinearMap.range (ι R : M →ₗ[R] ExteriorAlgebra R M) ^ n`).\r\n  - `ExteriorAlgebra.ιMulti_span_fixedDegree`: This range spans the `n`th exterior power.\r\n  - `ExteriorAlgebra.ιMulti_span`: The union over all `n` of the range of `ιMulti R n` spans the whole exterior algebra (this is in `LinearAlgebra/ExteriorAlgebra/Grading.lean` because the proof uses the graded module structure, but it might be possible to do something simpler).\r\n\r\n- Construct `ExteriorAlgebra.ιMulti_family`: This takes a natural number `n` and a family of vectors `v` indexed by a linearly ordered type `I`, and it returns the family of `n`-fold products of the `v i` in the exterior algebra, indexed by the set of finsets of `I` of cardinality `n`. (The point, to be proved in another PR, is that when `v` is a basis, then `ExteriorAlgebra.ιMulti_family R n v` is a basis of the `n`th exterior power.)\r\n\r\n---\r\n<!-- The text above the `---` will become the commit message when your\r\nPR is merged.
