The current definition would then be the special case `algebraicClosure \\bot`. But if we don't have a use case for this, maybe we should ignore it 😄\r\n\r\nThank you for the suggestion! I believe there is currently no immediate need for `IntermediateField.algebraicClosure`. For now, it can be achieved by `(algebraicClosure K F).restrictScalars E`. If we are going to state lemmas in this form, it might be a suitable opportunity to generalize the definition.\r\n",

I believe there is currently no immediate need for `IntermediateField.algebraicClosure`. For now, it can be achieved by `(algebraicClosure K F).restrictScalars E`. If we are going to state lemmas in this form, it might be a suitable opportunity to generalize the definition.\r\n",
