        "body": "- Remove the definition `def Matrix.IsCoxeter : Prop`. Replace it with a type `CoxeterMatrix B`, which is the type of all Coxeter matrices indexed by `B`.\r\n- Simplify the definitions of Coxeter matrices `Aₙ` (`n : ℕ`), `Bₙ` (`n : ℕ`), `Dₙ` (`n : ℕ`), `I₂ₘ` (`m : ℕ`), `E₆`, `E₇`, `E₈`, `F₄`, `G₂`, `H₃`, and `H₄`.\r\n- All definitions involving a matrix (including the definition of a Coxeter group, Coxeter relation, and Coxeter system) now require the matrix to be a Coxeter matrix.\r\n- Update docstrings of `GroupTheory.Coxeter.Basic` and `GroupTheory.Coxeter.Matrix`.\r\n  - The terms \"Coxeter matrix\", \"Coxeter group\", and \"Coxeter system\" are now defined in the header docstring.\r\n  - It is now clearer that the rank of a Coxeter system can be infinite.\r\n  - There is now a note in the implementation details of `GroupTheory.Coxeter.Matrix` about what happens when an entry of the Coxeter matrix is zero.\r\n  - There is now a note in the implementation details of `GroupTheory.Coxeter.Basic` about how we try to state our results in terms of the type `B` that indexes the simple reflections, rather than the set $S$ of simple reflections.\r\n- Rename these definitions, structures, and theorems. Previously, there were six namespaces to keep track of: `Matrix`, `Matrix.IsCoxeter`, `CoxeterMatrix`, `CoxeterGroup`, `CoxeterGroup.Relations`, and `CoxeterSystem`. It was difficult to guess the fully qualified name of many theorems, and the names were not designed for use with field notation. Instead, we put everything into two namespaces: `CoxeterMatrix` and `CoxeterSystem`.\r\n  - Rename `CoxeterGroup.Relations.ofMatrix` to `CoxeterMatrix.relation`. Also, change its type to `B → B → FreeGroup B`  (from `B × B → FreeGroup B`).\r\n  - Rename `CoxeterGroup.Relations.toSet` to `CoxeterMatrix.relationsSet`.\r\n  - Rename `Matrix.CoxeterGroup` to `CoxeterMatrix.group`.\r\n  - Rename `CoxeterGroup.of` to `CoxeterMatrix.simple`.\r\n  - Remove `CoxeterSystem.funLike`. Rename `CoxeterSystem.funLike.coe` to `CoxeterSystem.simple`, because \"simple reflection\" (or \"simple\" for short) is the name used in the literature for this concept, and it is unintuitive to think of a Coxeter system as a function.\r\n  - Rename `CoxeterSystem.funLike.coe_injective'`  and `CoxeterSystem.ext'`, which are exactly the same theorem, to `CoxeterSystem.simple_determines_coxeterSystem`. (This theorem is forthcoming in #11406.)\r\n  - Rename `CoxeterSystem.ofCoxeterGroup` to `CoxeterMatrix.toCoxeterSystem`. `CoxeterSystem.ofCoxeterGroup` is a confusing name because the input to the definition is an `CoxeterMatrix`, not a Coxeter group.\r\n  - Rename `CoxeterSystem.ofCoxeterGroup_apply` to `CoxeterMatrix.toCoxeterSystem_simple` and remove `@[simp]`. The theorem doesn't have a Coxeter system as input and it does have a `CoxeterMatrix` as input, so it makes more sense for it to be in the `CoxeterMatrix` namespace.\r\n  - Rename `CoxeterSystem.map_relations_eq_reindex_relations` to `CoxeterMatrix.reindex_relationsSet` and switch the two sides of the equality. The theorem doesn't mention Coxeter systems anywhere, so it shouldn't be in the `CoxeterSystem` namespace. Also, the new name better indicates what is on the left-hand side of the equality.\r\n  - Rename `CoxeterSystem.equivCoxeterGroup` to `CoxeterMatrix.reindexGroupEquiv` and switch the two sides of the equivalence. The definition doesn't mention Coxeter systems anywhere, so it shouldn't be in the `CoxeterSystem` namespace. Also, the new name conveys that the definition is about the Coxeter group associated to a reindexed matrix, rather than merely conveying that it is about an isomorphism of Coxeter groups.\r\n  - Rename `CoxeterSystem.equivCoxeterGroup_apply_of` to `CoxeterMatrix.reindexGroupEquiv_apply_simple`.\r\n  - Rename `CoxeterSystem.equivCoxeterGroup_symm_apply_of` `CoxeterMatrix.reindexGroupEquiv_symm_apply_simple`.\r\n  - Rename `CoxeterSystem.reindex_apply` to `CoxeterSystem.reindex_simple`.\r\n  - Rename `CoxeterSystem.map_apply` to `CoxeterSystem.map_simple`.\r\n- Simplify several of the proofs.\r\n\r\n---\r\n<!-- The text above the `---` will become the commit message when your\r\nPR is merged.

This needs to be changed. For example, `M.coxeterGroup` isn't \"the group presentation corresponding to `M`\". It's a group with a particular presentation; it's not a \"group presentation\".",

Move the definitions of `CoxeterMatrix B` and of Coxeter matrices `Aₙ` (`n : ℕ`), `Bₙ` (`n : ℕ`), `Dₙ` (`n : ℕ`), `I₂ₘ` (`m : ℕ`), `E₆`, `E₇`, `E₈`, `F₄`, `G₂`, `H₃` to `GroupTheory.Coxeter.Matrix`.\r\n\r\nAs a general rule of thumb, moving AND refactoring in a single PR is a no-go. Here are several solutions\r\n* Interleave moves and refactors (most general solution, sometimes necessary but often gratuitiously painful)\r\n* Move everything first, refactor after (not necessarily possible, but very clean when available, you need to motivate the moves with the upcoming refactors)\r\n* Refactor first, move everything after (not necessarily possible, but very clean when available, you need to convince the reviewers that the files you're refactoring can be made looking much better by moving things later)",

I think that splitting this into multiple pull requests would make it harder to review, not easier. For example, I could split this into two pull requests by refactoring first and then moving everything afterward. But then you'd be looking at the same thing, except it'd all be in one file. Moreover, this is already part of a chain of four pull requests, so the cost of splitting it is rather high.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, it makes the most sense to review this by reading the new code by itself without using the diff, and then using the PR description to check that it has the same features as the original. Everything has been moved or renamed in some way, but the total amount of code is very significantly smaller than the original if you do not count the extra documentation I added.",

              "body": "First, I hope we can agree that it is important that these definitions only apply to Coxeter matrices. `Matrix.CoxeterGroup` was a confusing name (even disregarding the capitalization), because, for example, `(!![[4]]).CoxeterGroup` is not a Coxeter group at all. (Also, I cannot imagine any situation in which someone would want to use this Coxeter group code to consider $\\langle s_i \\mid (s_i s_{i'})^{M_{i, i'}} \\rangle$ for a non-Coxeter matrix $M$.) The old `CoxeterSystem M W` also didn't require that `M` is a Coxeter matrix, and so that name was mathematically inaccurate as well.\r\n\r\nSince everything in the whole theory is only going to work for Coxeter matrices, there should be a type for Coxeter matrices. Otherwise you're carrying around both a `M : Matrix B B ℕ` and an `hM : M.IsCoxeter` everywhere, when you could just have an `M : CoxeterMatrix B`. This has another advantage: every definition that depends on a Coxeter matrix can go in the `CoxeterMatrix` namespace, and you can use field notation to access it. So, instead of `CoxeterGroup.Relations.ofMatrix M`, you have `M.relation`. Instead of `CoxeterSystem.map_relations_eq_reindex_relations M`, you have `M.reindex_relationsSet`. There is no longer any need to guess whether the particular theorem or definition you want is in `Matrix` or `Matrix.IsCoxeter` or `CoxeterGroup` or `CoxeterGroup.Relations` or if it somehow ended up in `CoxeterSystem`.",

Let $i \\in B$ be an index, and let $s_i \\in W$ be the result of applying the Coxeter system on $W$ to $i$.\r\n\r\nWhereas, you may find a passage like this:\r\n\r\n> Let $W$ be a Coxeter group whose simple reflections are indexed by a set $B$. Let $i \\in B$ be an index, and let $s_i \\in W$ be the corresponding simple reflection.\r\n\r\nBasically, no one thinks of $s_i$ as the result of \"applying\" a Coxeter system to $i$. The first time I read this file, I didn't understand what the `FunLike` instance was trying to do, because thinking of a Coxeter system as a function on $B$ is so far removed from how anyone I know has ever thought of Coxeter systems. I ended up defining `CoxeterSystem.simple` (actually, back then it was called `CoxeterSystem.simpleReflection`), and only later did I realize that `cs.simple i` was the same thing as the previously defined `cs i`.\r\n\r\nIt is true that `cs i` is shorter than `cs.simple i`. This doesn't really matter, in my opinion. `m n` is shorter than `Nat.gcd m n`, but no one would ever suggest making a `FunLike ℕ ℕ ℕ` so people could write `m n` instead of `Nat.gcd m n`.

This problem was exacerbated by the fact that there was also a largely unrelated namespace called `CoxeterGroup`.\r\n\r\nCalling it `Matrix.coxeterGroup` instead of `Matrix.CoxeterGroup` gets around these issues to a large extent.",

Also, there is a theorem `CoxeterMatrix.symmetric` that shows `∀ i i', M i i' = M i' i` and another theorem `CoxeterMatrix.isSymm` that shows `M.IsSymm`. Because `∀ i i', M i i' = M i' i` or `M.IsSymm` are interchangeable in this way, I am not convinced that it matters that much which one is used internally as part of the definition.\r\n\r\nEach way of writing the condition has its advantages, so I think it is good to supply both. For example, `M 2 3` can be rewritten to `M 3 2` using `M.symmetric`, which is easier than using `M.isSymm.apply`. But when we define the direct product of Coxeter groups, we will probably want to use [Matrix.IsSymm.fromBlocks](https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/Mathlib/LinearAlgebra/Matrix/Symmetric.html#Matrix.IsSymm.fromBlocks) on the Coxeter matrices of each component, which requires a `Matrix.IsSymm`.",

Here are several solutions\r\n* Interleave moves and refactors (most general solution, sometimes necessary but often gratuitiously painful)\r\n* Move everything first, refactor after (not necessarily possible, but very clean when available, you need to motivate the moves with the upcoming refactors)\r\n* Refactor first, move everything after (not necessarily possible, but very clean when available, you need to convince the reviewers that the files you're refactoring can be made looking much better by moving things later)",

I think that splitting this into multiple pull requests would make it harder to review, not easier. For example, I could split this into two pull requests by refactoring first and then moving everything afterward. But then you'd be looking at the same thing, except it'd all be in one file. Moreover, this is already part of a chain of four pull requests, so the cost of splitting it is rather high.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, it makes the most sense to review this by reading the new code by itself without using the diff, and then using the PR description to check that it has the same features as the original.

              "body": "First, I hope we can agree that it is important that these definitions only apply to Coxeter matrices. `Matrix.CoxeterGroup` was a confusing name (even disregarding the capitalization), because, for example, `(!![[4]]).CoxeterGroup` is not a Coxeter group at all. (Also, I cannot imagine any situation in which someone would want to use this Coxeter group code to consider $\\langle s_i \\mid (s_i s_{i'})^{M_{i, i'}} \\rangle$ for a non-Coxeter matrix $M$.) The old `CoxeterSystem M W` also didn't require that `M` is a Coxeter matrix, and so that name was mathematically inaccurate as well.\r\n\r\nSince everything in the whole theory is only going to work for Coxeter matrices, there should be a type for Coxeter matrices. Otherwise you're carrying around both a `M : Matrix B B ℕ` and an `hM : M.IsCoxeter` everywhere, when you could just have an `M : CoxeterMatrix B`. This has another advantage: every definition that depends on a Coxeter matrix can go in the `CoxeterMatrix` namespace, and you can use field notation to access it. So, instead of `CoxeterGroup.Relations.ofMatrix M`, you have `M.relation`. Instead of `CoxeterSystem.map_relations_eq_reindex_relations M`, you have `M.reindex_relationsSet`. There is no longer any need to guess whether the particular theorem or definition you want is in `Matrix` or `Matrix.IsCoxeter` or `CoxeterGroup` or `CoxeterGroup.Relations` or if it somehow ended up in `CoxeterSystem`.",

Let $i \\in B$ be an index, and let $s_i \\in W$ be the result of applying the Coxeter system on $W$ to $i$.\r\n\r\nWhereas, you may find a passage like this:\r\n\r\n> Let $W$ be a Coxeter group whose simple reflections are indexed by a set $B$. Let $i \\in B$ be an index, and let $s_i \\in W$ be the corresponding simple reflection.\r\n\r\nBasically, no one thinks of $s_i$ as the result of \"applying\" a Coxeter system to $i$. The first time I read this file, I didn't understand what the `FunLike` instance was trying to do, because thinking of a Coxeter system as a function on $B$ is so far removed from how anyone I know has ever thought of Coxeter systems. I ended up defining `CoxeterSystem.simple` (actually, back then it was called `CoxeterSystem.simpleReflection`), and only later did I realize that `cs.simple i` was the same thing as the previously defined `cs i`.\r\n\r\nIt is true that `cs i` is shorter than `cs.simple i`. This doesn't really matter, in my opinion. `m n` is shorter than `Nat.gcd m n`, but no one would ever suggest making a `FunLike ℕ ℕ ℕ` so people could write `m n` instead of `Nat.gcd m n`. Also, one can use local notation to write something like `s i`, which is shorter than both `cs i` and `cs.simple i`.",
