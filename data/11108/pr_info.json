That would avoid making `SetIntegral` overlong, and would also be a step in the right direction for `Bochner.lean`.",

This feels strange to me. It looks like you never actually use the fact that there's a `𝕜`-linear structure; you just need to know that `L` is Lipschitz in both variables. (But maybe we don't have the API to state that in its natural degree of generality.)",
