Let me explain why I need regularity here, I'm curious to hear your thoughts on the matter.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, `IsCompact` and `IsLindelöf` are defined in terms of filters rather than open covers. By analogy, I wanted to do the same thing for `IsKappaLindelöf`. This goes well, until `IsKappaLindelof.elim_cardinal_subcover`, which is the result that proves that the filter-based definition of `IsKappaLindelöf` reduces to the \"usual\" definition of these spaces. Here we need to show that a union of less than `κ` sets which are each of cardinality less than `κ` again has cardinality less than `κ`. This is https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/Mathlib/SetTheory/Cardinal/Cofinality.html#Cardinal.card_biUnion_lt_iff_forall_of_isRegular, which I added a while back (for this purpose) and for which I couldn't manage to prove the needed direction without assuming `κ` was regular. Any result that is currently proven using this open cover property then automatically needs this assumption that `κ` is regular, which is a bit unfortunate. \r\n\r\nI could try to redefine everything in terms of open covers, but I wasn't entirely sure if we wouldn't end up needing regularity later on anyway. If you have thoughts on this, I'm very happy to hear them.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if you know of a way to make https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/Mathlib/SetTheory/Cardinal/Cofinality.html#Cardinal.card_biUnion_lt_iff_forall_of_isRegular independent of the regularity assumption (and replacing it by assuming that the cardinal is infinite), I'm more than happy to hear this as well, but I'm not sure if this is possible mathematically. (The way I understand regularity is that it sort of imposes this very property). ",

No time-table for that exists however.\r\n\r\nA final note. There are in fact editorial standards for what gets put into pi-Base: we are a database of results that are of interest to researchers, so everything needs to be connected to standard textbook results, or else a peer-reviewed paper. So there's no fear of uncountably-many results being introduced in pi-Base, but I do think we're interested in modeling a bigger chunk of topology than Mathlib is. (Actually, I don't think this property is in pi-Base currently, but it's certainly in scope. It'd need to be $\\aleph_1$-Lindelof since we don't support properties defined for arbitrary cardinalities, yet.)",

I've been swamped by my own research project for the last months, and with teaching coming up, I don't know when exactly I'll have time to return to some more serious Lean, so I'll pick it up once I find some time for this. I think this file is rather much of a leaf-file to Mathlib, but if it blocks progress/someone wants to see it in Mathlib soon, anyone is free to push to this branch based on the corresponding Zulip chat! \r\n",

If you're reviewing: as you might notice, some results depend on `hreg : Cardinal.IsRegular κ`, which comes up in `IsKLindelof.elim_cardinal_subcover`. It is crucially needed to apply `card_biUnion_lt_iff_forall_of_isRegular`, which is a result I recently added to `Cofinality`. I think that that result cannot do without the `Cardinal.IsRegular κ` assumption, but I'm not entirely sure.

Let me explain why I need regularity here, I'm curious to hear your thoughts on the matter.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, `IsCompact` and `IsLindelöf` are defined in terms of filters rather than open covers. By analogy, I wanted to do the same thing for `IsKappaLindelöf`. This goes well, until `IsKappaLindelof.elim_cardinal_subcover`, which is the result that proves that the filter-based definition of `IsKappaLindelöf` reduces to the \"usual\" definition of these spaces. Here we need to show that a union of less than `κ` sets which are each of cardinality less than `κ` again has cardinality less than `κ`. This is https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/Mathlib/SetTheory/Cardinal/Cofinality.html#Cardinal.card_biUnion_lt_iff_forall_of_isRegular, which I added a while back (for this purpose) and for which I couldn't manage to prove the needed direction without assuming `κ` was regular. Any result that is currently proven using this open cover property then automatically needs this assumption that `κ` is regular, which is a bit unfortunate. \r\n\r\nI could try to redefine everything in terms of open covers, but I wasn't entirely sure if we wouldn't end up needing regularity later on anyway. If you have thoughts on this, I'm very happy to hear them.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if you know of a way to make https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/Mathlib/SetTheory/Cardinal/Cofinality.html#Cardinal.card_biUnion_lt_iff_forall_of_isRegular independent of the regularity assumption (and replacing it by assuming that the cardinal is infinite), I'm more than happy to hear this as well, but I'm not sure if this is possible mathematically. (The way I understand regularity is that it sort of imposes this very property). ",

(Actually, I don't think this property is in pi-Base currently, but it's certainly in scope. It'd need to be ℵ1-Lindelof since we don't support properties defined for arbitrary cardinalities, yet.)\r\n\r\nI never meant to suggest there are no editorial standards in pi-base! I simply meant that Mathlib and pi-base have different goals so they have different standards, so being suitable for pi-base does not automatically imply being suitable for Mathlib.",

I've been swamped by my own research project for the last months, and with teaching coming up, I don't know when exactly I'll have time to return to some more serious Lean, so I'll pick it up once I find some time for this. I think this file is rather much of a leaf-file to Mathlib, but if it blocks progress/someone wants to see it in Mathlib soon, anyone is free to push to this branch based on the corresponding Zulip chat! \r\n",
