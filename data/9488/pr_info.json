(will be in later PR)\r\n\r\n- `IsPurelyInseparable.normal`: a purely inseparable extension is normal.\r\n\r\n- `separableClosure.isPurelyInseparable`: if `E / F` is algebraic, then `E` is purely inseparable\r\n  over the (relative) separable closure of `E / F`.\r\n\r\n- `IsPurelyInseparable.injective_comp_algebraMap`: if `E / F` is purely inseparable, then for any\r\n  reduced ring `L`, the map `(E →+* L) → (F →+* L)` induced by `algebraMap F E` is injective.\r\n  In other words, a purely inseparable field extension is an epimorphism in the category of fields.\r\n\r\n- `isPurelyInseparable_adjoin_iff_mem_pow`: if `F` is of exponential characteristic `q`, then\r\n  `F(S) / F` is a purely inseparable extension if and only if for any `x ∈ S`, `x ^ (q ^ n)` is\r\n  contained in `F` for some `n : ℕ`.\r\n\r\n- `Field.finSepDegree_eq`: if `E / F` is algebraic, then the `Field.finSepDegree F E` is equal to\r\n  `Field.sepDegree F E` as a natural number. This means that the cardinality of `Field.Emb F E`\r\n  and the degree of `(separableClosure F E) / F` are both finite or infinite, and when they are\r\n  finite, they coincide.\r\n\r\nTODO: (will be in later PR)\r\n\r\n- `IsPurelyInseparable.of_injective_comp_algebraMap`: if `L` is an algebraically closed field\r\n  containing `E`, such that the map `(E →+* L) → (F →+* L)` induced by `algebraMap F E` is\r\n  injective, then `E / F` is purely inseparable. In other words, epimorphisms in the category of\r\n  fields must be purely inseparable extensions. Need to use the fact that `Emb F E` is infintie\r\n  when `E / F` is (purely) transcendental.\r\n\r\n- Prove that the (infinite) inseparable degree are multiplicative; linearly disjoint argument is needed.\r\n\r\n---\r\n<!-- The text above the `---` will become the commit message when your\r\nPR is merged.

Two ways to fix it:\r\n- Prove that if `K / k` is algebraic, `k` is perfect, then `K` is also perfect. This seems to require separable degree argument.\r\n- Prove a modified version of `IsAlgClosed.of_exists_root` which states that if `K / k` is algebraic, any monic irreducible polynomial over `k` ~~has a root~~ splits in `K`, then `K` is algebraically closed (in fact an algebraic closure of `k`).\r\n\r\nI think both of them are important results, but not in mathlib yet.",

Condition (1) is basically `trans` and `tower_top/bot` lemmas, and Condition (3) is `sup` lemmas (follows from (1) and (2)). Condition (2) says if K and L are intermediate fields of E/F and if K/F is in the class, then KL/L is also in the class. In Lean this can be generalized to say that if E/L/F is a tower and K is an intermediate field of E/F such that K/F is in the class, then `adjoin L K` over `L` is in the class. This type of lemmas seem to be missing from mathlib at this moment and it looks like they may be useful in places like this.",
