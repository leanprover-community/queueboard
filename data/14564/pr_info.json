Some lemmas about bounded/cobounded functions to handle limsup max.\r\n- Same identities with supremum/infimum indexed over a Finset: `limsup_finset_sup`, `liminf_finset_inf`, `limsup_finset_sup'`, `liminf_finset_inf'`.\r\n- ~Some identities defined on Conditionally complete linear orders now have versions on Complete linear orders. The autocomplete tactic doesn't work very well, so in practice they can be very helpful. Example: `limsup_le_limsup'`.~\r\n\r\nThis file is in dire need of a refactor. It is getting too long ; the linter fails because the file has reached almost 1800 lines (I am not sure if it makes sense to disable the flag as long as we don't go over the limit of 1900 lines). There are many less immediate issues which would warrant some extensive work.\r\n\r\n---\r\n<!-- The text above the `---` will become the commit message when your\r\nPR is merged.

One lemma about the sup was not useful, while I've added two lemmas about the inf which are.",
