I have decided that the current proof was too ugly and specific to be worth spending more time on, so I have started formalising the general random variable version.\r\n\r\nAlong the way, I've made another big change: Instead of generalising to inner product spaces by taking a basis (bootstrapping), I rewrote the entire proof to handle products of inner products rather than products. This makes the proof a bit more complicated in places, but overall seems to work nicer AND gives a constant that does not depend on the dimension of the space.\r\n\r\nThere are still a few sorries left (10 at the time of writing), but none of them should be particularly challenging.\r\n\r\nPS: The lemmas Heather wrote disappeared from this PR because I don't need them anymore and I have PRed them separately.",

I have decided that the current proof was too ugly and specific to be worth spending more time on, so I have started formalising the general random variable version.\r\n\r\nAlong the way, I've made another big change: Instead of generalising to inner product spaces by taking a basis (bootstrapping), I rewrote the entire proof to handle products of inner products rather than products. This makes the proof a bit more complicated in places, but overall seems to work nicer AND gives a constant that does not depend on the dimension of the space.\r\n\r\nThere are still a few sorries left (10 at the time of writing), but none of them should be particularly challenging.\r\n\r\nPS: The lemmas Heather wrote disappeared from this PR because I don't need them anymore and I have PRed them separately.",
