However, every `#`-command now emits a message: either because the command itself does, or because the linter does (but not both!).  This means that CI will pick up `#`-commands no matter what.",

(leanprover/lean4#3806) Namely, it should recurse into `stx[2]` (the command syntax), not `stx[1]` (which is the token `\"in\"`). You'll notice that currently,\r\n```lean\r\nset_option lean.hashCommand true in\r\n#print 0\r\n```\r\ndoesn't work as expected.\r\n\r\nSo it should actually be \r\n```lean\r\nopen Command in\r\n/-- Exactly like `withSetOptionIn`, but recursively discards any other use of `in`. Intended to be \r\nused in the hashcommand linter, where we don't need to handle non-`set_option` `in` commands. -/\r\nprivate partial def withSetOptionIn' (cmd : CommandElab) : CommandElab := fun stx => do\r\n  if stx.getKind == ``Lean.Parser.Command.in then\r\n    if stx[0].getKind == ``Lean.Parser.Command.set_option then\r\n      let opts ← Elab.elabSetOption stx[0][1] stx[0][2]\r\n      Command.withScope (fun scope => { scope with opts }) do\r\n        withSetOptionIn' cmd stx[2]\r\n    else\r\n      withSetOptionIn' cmd stx[2]\r\n  else\r\n    cmd stx\r\n```\r\nNote also that since `#guard_msgs in` doesn't actually use the `Lean.Parser.Command.in` parser for `in` (its `\" in\"` is defined in its own syntax, unlike e.g. `set_option ... in`), it's exempt from `withSetOptionIn'`. (This is also why the linter doesn't fire twice in each `#guard_msgs` test: at the top level, it hits the docstring on `#guard_msgs` and stops, which is actually quite useful.)\r\n\r\nA good test for `withSetOptionIn'` would of course be something like\r\n```lean\r\nvariable [Nonempty x] in\r\n#synth Nonempty x\r\n```\r\n\r\nSince the only reason this linter doesn't catch `#guard_msgs` is the presence of a preceding docstring, and since I'm pretty sure that's unique to `#guard_msgs`, I'm okay with `#guard_msgs` not being linted against! Linting against `#guard_msgs` would also make testing the linter itself difficult. Especially since an accidental `#guard_msgs` would be (I think!) very rare.\r\n\r\nI'm happy to push these changes if it would be convenient for you (I've now tested them locally), but if you'd like to make them yourself that's fine too! :)",
