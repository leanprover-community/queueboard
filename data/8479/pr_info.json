(I'm not sure if a `leaff` comment everywhere would lead to fatigue.)\r\nAdditionally, if `leaff` is opt-in, you could roll this out earlier - it doesn't have to be perfect. I'd rather have this now, as an alpha version, rather than waiting for a month for the perfect tool to arrive.\r\n\r\nFor small PRs or those only adding a few lemmas here and there, I don't think this output provides too much value. For large PRs (e.g. splitting files, moving declarations or renaming lemmas), having this tool to check would be extremely helpful --- both as an author and reviewer",

My current plan is to improve Leaff a bit more to handle imports and things like move+rename as a single step better (and maybe attributes / envextensions) and then open a discussion on the Zulip. I think that the discussion may well be influenced by what the output of the tool looks like (if it is unnecessarily verbose that would be less desirable to always run). I'd like to get this done in the next couple of weeks.\r\n\r\nIf one wants to simply see the output of Leaff on a PR today, for now the easiest way is to make a new branch from the one you are working on (`git checkout my-working-branch; git checkout -b my-wrking-branch-with-leaff`), merge this branch into it (`git merge alexjbest/leaff`) and then push that so that CI will then run on it (somewhat quickly if there are oleans already) and the output will show up in the checks summary page (e.g. https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/actions/runs/6937276526?pr=8479)",

I'd rather have this now, as an alpha version, rather than waiting for a month for the perfect tool to arrive.\r\n\r\nFor small PRs or those only adding a few lemmas here and there, I don't think this output provides too much value. For large PRs (e.g. splitting files, moving declarations or renaming lemmas), having this tool to check would be extremely helpful --- both as an author and reviewer",

My current plan is to improve Leaff a bit more to handle imports and things like move+rename as a single step better (and maybe attributes / envextensions) and then open a discussion on the Zulip. I think that the discussion may well be influenced by what the output of the tool looks like (if it is unnecessarily verbose that would be less desirable to always run). I'd like to get this done in the next couple of weeks.\r\n\r\nIf one wants to simply see the output of Leaff on a PR today, for now the easiest way is to make a new branch from the one you are working on (`git checkout my-working-branch; git checkout -b my-wrking-branch-with-leaff`), merge this branch into it (`git merge alexjbest/leaff`) and then push that so that CI will then run on it (somewhat quickly if there are oleans already) and the output will show up in the checks summary page (e.g. https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/actions/runs/6937276526?pr=8479)",
