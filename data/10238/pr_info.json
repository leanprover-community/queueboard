The long term aim is to be able to consider quadratic maps.\r\n\r\nThe main change is to `LinearAlgebra/QuadraticForm/Basic`, but this necessitates changes throughout `LinearAlgebra/QuadraticForm/`. Minor changes are also required elsewhere:\r\n\r\n- `LinearAlgebra/CliffordAlgebra/`\r\n- `LinearAlgebra/Matrix/PosDef`\r\n- `LinearAlgebra/SesquilinearForm`\r\n- A number of additional results about tensor products and linear maps are also required.\r\n\r\n---\r\n<!-- The text above the `---` will become the commit message when your\r\nPR is merged.
