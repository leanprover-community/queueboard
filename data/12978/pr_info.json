This API is extensively used in an upcoming PR defining the notion of fibered categories.

That would be helpful for automation when defining  `IsHomLift` instances. For example, I feel that the `domain_eq` field of `comp_lift_id_right` should be able to be automated. Do you know if this is possible in any way?\r\n\r\nOne thought I just had, is that maybe it could be a good idea to add the class `IsObjLift`, which would allow type-class inference to infer `domain_eq` and `codomain_eq`.

I will keep this in mind for the other proofs in this PR (I think it might become especially relevant for the other IsFibered PR).

That would be helpful for automation when defining  `IsHomLift` instances. For example, I feel that the `domain_eq` field of `comp_lift_id_right` should be able to be automated. Do you know if this is possible in any way?\r\n\r\nOne thought I just had, is that maybe it could be a good idea to add the class `IsObjLift`, which would allow type-class inference to infer `domain_eq` and `codomain_eq`.
