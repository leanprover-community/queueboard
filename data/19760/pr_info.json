E.g. how painful are products?\r\n\r\nI think overall the definition feels good to work with. Always considering the relative case often makes the proofs a little bit more complicated than in the books. But I guess this just comes with generalization. And I am not knowledgeable enough to know whether specific statements are generally used in the relative or only in the absolute version.\r\n\r\nProducts are painful but I don't think they are too much more painful then they already are on paper. Mathematically I could basically just follow the proof in Hatcher.",

Firstly, the majority of the code I have written is about different constructions (e.g. subcomplexes and products) and properties (mainly finiteness) about them. It is really convenient to talk about finiteness of a subcomplex without having to specify every time why that statement even makes sense, especially if you start taking unions of subcomplexes and things like that. I am not sure at all about my second point but I think a lot of the time you actually care more that a space is a CW-complex (with some property maybe) than about the actual CW-structure, i.e. I think a lot of times being a CW-complex is treated as a property rather than data.",

I have some mainly stylistical comments (which should be independent of the open design questions).\r\n\r\nYour first question: `export` is clever; I'd have to read up on if this does what you want. (Generally, one common solution in such situations is to have \"morally the same\" API twice.) \r\n\r\nAbout the second question, and the location of this file. There's indeed a name collision. The current scheme \"RelCWComplex\" versus \"RelativeCWComplex\" doesn't seem ideal yet... one could\r\n- rename the abstract definitions \"AbstractCWComplex\" and \"AbstractRelCWComplex\", and name yours \"ClassicalCWComplex\" and \"ClassicalRelCWComplex\", or\r\n- do some combination of these two, giving one name \"preference\" (i.e. \"CWComplex\" means the abstract one, \"ClassicalCWComplex\" is yours). I'm not convinced by this, though.\r\n\r\nIn any case, it would be helpful to have these definitions live next to each other. Perhaps move the existing file to `CWComplex/Basic.lean` and this file to `CWComplex/Classical.lean`? or `Abstract.lean` and `Classical.lean`? Perhaps this should be done once the naming is clearer...\r\n\r\nThese are not complete answers, but perhaps they're already helpful. Perhaps we can discuss more on Wednesday.",

Always considering the relative case often makes the proofs a little bit more complicated than in the books. But I guess this just comes with generalization. And I am not knowledgeable enough to know whether specific statements are generally used in the relative or only in the absolute version.\r\n\r\nProducts are painful but I don't think they are too much more painful then they already are on paper.
