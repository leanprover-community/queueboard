Always considering the relative case often makes the proofs a little bit more complicated than in the books. But I guess this just comes with generalization. And I am not knowledgeable enough to know whether specific statements are generally used in the relative or only in the absolute version.\r\n\r\nProducts are painful but I don't think they are too much more painful then they already are on paper. Mathematically I could basically just follow the proof in Hatcher.",

Perhaps this should be done once the naming is clearer...\r\n\r\n@grunweg Thank you for your suggestion on the names.\r\n\r\nHere I list three naming options for discussion.\r\n\r\n1. Currently there are `Topology.CWComplex.Abstract.Basic.lean` and `Topology.CWComplex.Classical.Basic.lean`.\r\nThese names are long but have the advantage of disambiguation since the terminology varies a lot across the literature.\r\n2. Perhaps we could use the shorter names `Topology.CWComplex.lean` (for the abstract definition) and `Topology.CWDecomp.lean` (for the classical definition) instead, where `CWDecomp` stands for \"CW decomposition\", which is the term used in Chapter 5 of John Lee's _Introduction to topological manifolds_.  I think the word \"decomposition\" accurately conveys the idea of partitioning a topological space into cells. (However, in Tammo tom Dieck's book, a CW-decomposition is related to the abstract definition. See the summary below.)\r\n3. Another option is to use the term \"Whitehead complex\" for the classical definition. This is used, e.g., in section 8.2 of Tammo tom Dieck's book _Algebraic topology_.\r\n\r\nHere's a summary of terminologies used in the two books.\r\n\r\n- John Lee's _Introduction to topological manifolds_\r\n  - A CW decomposition of `X` is a partition `𝓔` of `X` into open cells (with a characteristic map for each cell) such that `𝓔` is closure finite and `X` has the weak topology (with respect to the closure of the cells). This corresponds to the `Classical` definition.\r\n  - A CW complex is a Hausdorff space `X` together with a CW decomposition of `X`.\r\n  - The CW construction theorem (Theorem 5.20) shows that the `Abstract` definition implies the `Classical` definition.\r\n- Tammo tom Dieck's _Algebraic topology_\r\n  - A Whitehead complex (section 8.2) refers to the `Classical` definition.\r\n  - A CW-complex (section 8.3) refers to the `Abstract` definition.\r\n    - A CW-decomposition refers to the decomposition into skeletons, rather than cells.",

Firstly, the majority of the code I have written is about different constructions (e.g. subcomplexes and products) and properties (mainly finiteness) about them. It is really convenient to talk about finiteness of a subcomplex without having to specify every time why that statement even makes sense, especially if you start taking unions of subcomplexes and things like that. I am not sure at all about my second point but I think a lot of the time you actually care more that a space is a CW-complex (with some property maybe) than about the actual CW-structure, i.e. I think a lot of times being a CW-complex is treated as a property rather than data.",

I have some mainly stylistical comments (which should be independent of the open design questions).\r\n\r\nYour first question: `export` is clever; I'd have to read up on if this does what you want. (Generally, one common solution in such situations is to have \"morally the same\" API twice.) \r\n\r\nAbout the second question, and the location of this file. There's indeed a name collision. The current scheme \"RelCWComplex\" versus \"RelativeCWComplex\" doesn't seem ideal yet... one could\r\n- rename the abstract definitions \"AbstractCWComplex\" and \"AbstractRelCWComplex\", and name yours \"ClassicalCWComplex\" and \"ClassicalRelCWComplex\", or\r\n- do some combination of these two, giving one name \"preference\" (i.e. \"CWComplex\" means the abstract one, \"ClassicalCWComplex\" is yours). I'm not convinced by this, though.\r\n\r\nIn any case, it would be helpful to have these definitions live next to each other. Perhaps move the existing file to `CWComplex/Basic.lean` and this file to `CWComplex/Classical.lean`? or `Abstract.lean` and `Classical.lean`? Perhaps this should be done once the naming is clearer...\r\n\r\nThese are not complete answers, but perhaps they're already helpful. Perhaps we can discuss more on Wednesday.",

Always considering the relative case often makes the proofs a little bit more complicated than in the books. But I guess this just comes with generalization. And I am not knowledgeable enough to know whether specific statements are generally used in the relative or only in the absolute version.\r\n\r\nProducts are painful but I don't think they are too much more painful then they already are on paper.

Currently the naming clashes with the other definition.\r\n\r\n@scholzhannah @fpvandoorn  Thanks for your great work!\r\n\r\n> or `Abstract.lean` and `Classical.lean`? Perhaps this should be done once the naming is clearer...\r\n\r\n@grunweg Thank you for your suggestion on the names.\r\n\r\nHere I list three naming options for discussion.\r\n\r\n1. Currently there are `Topology.CWComplex.Abstract.Basic.lean` and `Topology.CWComplex.Classical.Basic.lean`.\r\nThese names are long but have the advantage of disambiguation since the terminology varies a lot across the literature.\r\n2. Perhaps we could use the shorter names `Topology.CWComplex.lean` (for the abstract definition) and `Topology.CWDecomp.lean` (for the classical definition) instead, where `CWDecomp` stands for \"CW decomposition\", which is the term used in Chapter 5 of John Lee's _Introduction to topological manifolds_.  I think the word \"decomposition\" accurately conveys the idea of partitioning a topological space into cells. (However, in Tammo tom Dieck's book, a CW-decomposition is related to the abstract definition. See the summary below.)\r\n3. Another option is to use the term \"Whitehead complex\" for the classical definition. This is used, e.g., in section 8.2 of Tammo tom Dieck's book _Algebraic topology_.\r\n\r\nHere's a summary of terminologies used in the two books.\r\n\r\n- John Lee's _Introduction to topological manifolds_\r\n  - A CW decomposition of `X` is a partition `𝓔` of `X` into open cells (with a characteristic map for each cell) such that `𝓔` is closure finite and `X` has the weak topology (with respect to the closure of the cells). This corresponds to the `Classical` definition.\r\n  - A CW complex is a Hausdorff space `X` together with a CW decomposition of `X`.\r\n  - The CW construction theorem (Theorem 5.20) shows that the `Abstract` definition implies the `Classical` definition.\r\n- Tammo tom Dieck's _Algebraic topology_\r\n  - A Whitehead complex (section 8.2) refers to the `Classical` definition.\r\n  - A CW-complex (section 8.3) refers to the `Abstract` definition.\r\n    - A CW-decomposition refers to the decomposition into skeletons, rather than cells.",
