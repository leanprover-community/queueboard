I had indeed implemented only those suggested generalizations in the mathlib3 PR which were provable, and left two unprovable ones unproven (and since Sébastien had also used a very different tone in the unprovable ones, I interpreted them more as rhetorical questions for contrast in the first place). I hope the file also makes it evident that the chosen formulations were deliberate, for example by the different use \"as δ tends to zero\" vs \"as δ>0 tends to zero\" in the docstrings.\r\n\r\nI don't have an opinion on whether we should wait for further reviews from Sébastien and/or Yury. I believe I took into account all of their review comments so far (but I don't know if they would have had further ones). So either way is ok with me.",

In general I would suggest using the `Eventually` version over the `_ ∈ ℱ` version in `filter_upwards` when both exist, but it's not really important.",

I had indeed implemented only those suggested generalizations in the mathlib3 PR which were provable, and left two unprovable ones unproven (and since Sébastien had also used a very different tone in the unprovable ones, I interpreted them more as rhetorical questions for contrast in the first place). I hope the file also makes it evident that the chosen formulations were deliberate, for example by the different use \"as δ tends to zero\" vs \"as δ>0 tends to zero\" in the docstrings.\r\n\r\nI don't have an opinion on whether we should wait for further reviews from Sébastien and/or Yury. I believe I took into account all of their review comments so far (but I don't know if they would have had further ones). So either way is ok with me.",
