I do not have anything agains your `WithAbs` approach, but if a unified one can be used for both the archimedean and the non-archimedean situation, that would be preferable.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me that it helps to think about `v`-adic valuations as discrete integer-valued multiplicative valuations, instead of real absolute values, since e.g. then we don't need to make a choice of base (probably there are better reasons!). But, since this is not possible for the infinite places, to fully unify them we could turn a `v`-adic valuation into a `v`-adic absolute value, then we might use `AbsoluteValue.completion` for both the finite and infinite places. But that sounds like a lot of refactoring for the `adicCompletion` API, and I imagine there's a lot of material from the `Valued` API that is made use of for `adicCompletion` and is not available for `AbsoluteValue`.

Forget my suggestion to use `Valuation`. But I guess that the main point we were trying to make with @riccardobrasca is that in the same vein as [Valued.mk'](https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/Mathlib/Topology/Algebra/Valued/ValuationTopology.html#Valued.mk') associates a valued structure to a Valuation, it seems that simply creating a `NormedRing.mk` that takes an absolute value and creates a normed ring might be a good solution. At least, it works very well in the nonarchimedean setting, _mutatis mutandis._ The rest of your PR would be hardly modified, I guess.",

In the latest commit I have done the following:\r\n- Defined `def normedField` inside the `AbsoluteValue` namespace in a separate file that takes an `AbsoluteValue` and returns a `NormedField` class -- I think this is neater and makes the `NormedField` construction available for other usage, so thanks for the suggestion @riccardobrasca !\r\n- Removed the `NormedRing` and `NormOneClass` instances. I did not replace these with `def` versions in the `AbsoluteValue` namespace, because I realised I don't actually need them. Let me know if you think I should add them anyway for completeness -- I guess `NormedRing` is the lowest possible level for `AbsoluteValue`.\r\n- I have kept the usage of `WithAbs` and included a paragraph in the documentation to explain a bit about this approach. If we remove it then we will need to use `@` (like the [non-Archimedean case](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/blob/6dcd0d943385f315b956fc76968c842a3ad4072c/Mathlib/RingTheory/DedekindDomain/AdicValuation.lean#L365)) or `letI := ...`, which I had in the old PR.

              "body": "> On top of all my previous comments, I have been thinking that perhaps another solution instead of your type alias would be to define a structure (probably not upgraded to a class, but I would expand on this at a later stage) `WithAbsRing` with two fields: a ring and an absolute value on it. Have you tried this idea? I think it would make your life easier both when trying to construct a sub-WithAbsRing from a given one; and when constructing a `WithAbsRing` from an infinite place, by doing `WithAbsRing.mk K v.1` (for `K` the field and `v` the infinite place). All your duplicated code with the `inferInstanceAs` would be automatically OK, once you prove your results (like those about an absolute value that factors through a complex embedding), and attach to an infinite place a term of this structure as above.\r\n> \r\n\r\nI'm not sure if this is what you had in mind, but I tried this as the following\r\n```\r\nstructure AbsoluteValued (R S : Type*) [Semiring R] [OrderedSemiring S]\r\n    where\r\n  abs : AbsoluteValue R S\r\n  value : R\r\n```\r\nBut it's not clear to me where to go from here with such a structure. I think `class` might be better because it should extend `Semiring` and `NormedField`, so that it has access to these instances I think? I have not interacted much with `structure` so this is probably my ignorance at play here. \r\n\r\nI think it might be helpful to make a more concrete analogy to the non-Archimedean case to clarify the options here. In the non-Archimedean case we want to use the [`Valued`](https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/Mathlib/Topology/Algebra/Valued/ValuationTopology.html#Valued) class which carries the `UniformSpace` structure we are interested in, but this has a distinguished valuation whereas we have multiple valuations. So there is a constructor [`Valued.mk'`](https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/Mathlib/Topology/Algebra/Valued/ValuationTopology.html#Valued.mk') which constructs the `Valued` instance when there is no preferred valuation/uniform structure. Then a `def` is made for [`adicValued`](https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/Mathlib/RingTheory/DedekindDomain/AdicValuation.html#IsDedekindDomain.HeightOneSpectrum.adicValued) which carries these `Valued` instances. In particular, [`adicCompletion`](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/blob/3ca1060d7e48260d1b1b7a0733f887e455455226/Mathlib/RingTheory/DedekindDomain/AdicValuation.lean#L365-L366) calls `adicValued.toUniformSpace` using the `@` operator.\r\n\r\nNow for the Archimedean case, the [`NormedField`](https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/Mathlib/Analysis/Normed/Field/Basic.html#NormedField) class plays the role of `Valued`. Again this has a distinguished norm, so we want a way of creating an instance for non-distinguished norms (or absolute values in this case). I think there are two main options here: (1) in analogy to non-Arch. case we create a `NormedField.mk'` constructor taking an absolute value and giving a `NormedField` instance, assign this to a `def`, then use `@` operators as appropriate; (2) create a type synonym that depends on absolute values, in order to assign the `NormedField` instance as in this PR. It's not clear to me where a new structure fits in to these options. \r\n\r\nBy the way, I did not realise this but those `inferInstanceAs` can actually just be deleted with the type synonym approach as well (except for `Coe` I think).\r\n\r\n> Perhaps a word about why \"type synonyms\" are raising so much scepticism: there is nothing inherently bad with them, and there are very high chances that your solution is excellent. Nevertheless, they are seldom used in the library, whereas bundling things through `structures` appears everywhere. I have the feeling that your guiding principle here is not really \"create another copy of `R` that I want to call something else than `Ring` for whatever reason\"; rather, to bundle together the underlying ring and an absolute value on it, and we're used to do so with structures. Clearly, \"we're used to...\" is a social thing, and I would be very happy to be convinced that in this case your suggestion is far better; on the other hand, surfing the wave and benefitting of all the infrastructure built around structures (pun not intended) could be useful.\r\n> \r\nI agree with a previous comment that the use of \"equip\" is misleading in the documentation, and I can see where the scepticism is coming from! My guiding principle for using a type synonym is less about \"equipping\" the ring with an absolute value, but really more about providing a mechanism for type class inferencing to handle non-preferential instances without using the `@` operator. So actually I do want to create another copy of a ring, but one that explicitly depends on an absolute value, so that I can sensibly assign instances that depend on absolute values to it. I think I'm arguing that the `NormedField` and `Valued` classes provide the \"bundling\" mechanisms, and the `Valued.mk'` and `WithAbs` are two different ways of making that bundling mechanism non-preferential. There is at least some precedence for doing this with type synonyms in [WithLp](https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/Mathlib/Analysis/Normed/Lp/WithLp.html#The-WithLp-type-synonym), which does something very similar for the $L^p$ norm -- maybe it would be helpful to separate `WithAbs` into a more developed API like this?",

It seems that mathlib's strategy is to use `Valuation.mk` to turn a valuation into an instance of `Valued` (something you can do locally in a file) and then play with it. I think that here the situation is the same, with a valuation replaced by an absolute value and `Valued` replaced by `NormedRing`.",

Actually, in my original approach in #13577  I used the model of [`Valued`](https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/Mathlib/Topology/Algebra/Valued/ValuationTopology.html#Valued) and [`HeightOneSpectrum.adicCompletion`](https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/Mathlib/RingTheory/DedekindDomain/AdicValuation.html#IsDedekindDomain.HeightOneSpectrum.adicCompletion). This worked fine, but then I needed to use either lots of `@`s or `letI := v.normedField`s everywhere to explicitly tell the system which uniform space structure I needed. The type synonym approach of `WithAbs` lets the inference system take care of this, so it seems a bit neater to me, but we can keep `WithAbs` and its instances while abstracting the `normedRing` definitions to an `AbsoluteValue` file/namespace as you suggest. I will take a look!",

Or do you find any advantage of using the latter rather than the former (beyond the problem that `InfinitePlaces` are defined using `AbsoluteValue` but this can be refactored)?",

Maybe worth having a discussion on Zulip if you can't see my suggestion working.

But, since this is not possible for the infinite places, to fully unify them we could turn a `v`-adic valuation into a `v`-adic absolute value, then we might use `AbsoluteValue.completion` for both the finite and infinite places. But that sounds like a lot of refactoring for the `adicCompletion` API, and I imagine there's a lot of material from the `Valued` API that is made use of for `adicCompletion` and is not available for `AbsoluteValue`.

It is possible to do this without `WithAbs` and using only `(v : AbsoluteValue R ℝ)`. Then we might have something like `def AbsoluteValue.normedField : NormedField K ...`. This is similar to my original approach in #13577. In that case then we either need to use lots of `letI := v.normedField` or `@`s to tell the inference system which uniform space instances we mean (at least for the `AbsoluteValue` completion part). The type synonym approach of `WithAbs` allows the inference system take care of this, so it seems a bit neater to me, although I'm happy to discuss further!\r\n> \r\n> Well, we certainly prefer neat code ;-) So I'd like to understand better if your `@` business can be avoided by some fine use of the tools at our disposal, of there is really something deep going on.

Forget my suggestion to use `Valuation`. But I guess that the main point we were trying to make with @riccardobrasca is that in the same vein as [Valued.mk'](https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/Mathlib/Topology/Algebra/Valued/ValuationTopology.html#Valued.mk') associates a valued structure to a Valuation, it seems that simply creating a `NormedRing.mk` that takes an absolute value and creates a normed ring might be a good solution. At least, it works very well in the nonarchimedean setting, _mutatis mutandis._ The rest of your PR would be hardly modified, I guess.",

I think `class` might be better because it should extend `Semiring` and `NormedField`, so that it has access to these instances I think? I have not interacted much with `structure` so this is probably my ignorance at play here. \r\n\r\nI think it might be helpful to make a more concrete analogy to the non-Archimedean case to clarify the options here. In the non-Archimedean case we want to use the [`Valued`](https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/Mathlib/Topology/Algebra/Valued/ValuationTopology.html#Valued) class which carries the `UniformSpace` structure we are interested in, but this has a distinguished valuation whereas we have multiple valuations. So there is a constructor [`Valued.mk'`](https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/Mathlib/Topology/Algebra/Valued/ValuationTopology.html#Valued.mk') which constructs the `Valued` instance when there is no preferred valuation/uniform structure. Then a `def` is made for [`adicValued`](https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/Mathlib/RingTheory/DedekindDomain/AdicValuation.html#IsDedekindDomain.HeightOneSpectrum.adicValued) which carries these `Valued` instances. In particular, [`adicCompletion`](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/blob/3ca1060d7e48260d1b1b7a0733f887e455455226/Mathlib/RingTheory/DedekindDomain/AdicValuation.lean#L365-L366) calls `adicValued.toUniformSpace` using the `@` operator.\r\n\r\nNow for the Archimedean case, the [`NormedField`](https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/Mathlib/Analysis/Normed/Field/Basic.html#NormedField) class plays the role of `Valued`. Again this has a distinguished norm, so we want a way of creating an instance for non-distinguished norms (or absolute values in this case). I think there are two main options here: (1) in analogy to non-Arch. case we create a `NormedField.mk'` constructor taking an absolute value and giving a `NormedField` instance, assign this to a `def`, then use `@` operators as appropriate; (2) create a type synonym that depends on absolute values, in order to assign the `NormedField` instance as in this PR. It's not clear to me where a new structure fits in to these options. \r\n\r\nBy the way, I did not realise this but those `inferInstanceAs` can actually just be deleted with the type synonym approach as well (except for `Coe` I think).\r\n\r\n> Perhaps a word about why \"type synonyms\" are raising so much scepticism: there is nothing inherently bad with them, and there are very high chances that your solution is excellent. Nevertheless, they are seldom used in the library, whereas bundling things through `structures` appears everywhere.

My guiding principle for using a type synonym is less about \"equipping\" the ring with an absolute value, but really more about providing a mechanism for type class inferencing to handle non-preferential instances without using the `@` operator. So actually I do want to create another copy of a ring, but one that explicitly depends on an absolute value, so that I can sensibly assign instances that depend on absolute values to it. I think I'm arguing that the `NormedField` and `Valued` classes provide the \"bundling\" mechanisms, and the `Valued.mk'` and `WithAbs` are two different ways of making that bundling mechanism non-preferential. There is at least some precedence for doing this with type synonyms in [WithLp](https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/Mathlib/Analysis/Normed/Lp/WithLp.html#The-WithLp-type-synonym), which does something very similar for the $L^p$ norm -- maybe it would be helpful to separate `WithAbs` into a more developed API like this?",

I did not go further, but I think from this point on I will have to do a bunch of sign-posting for the inference system to know what's going on. \r\n\r\nStill, I think this would work as a third option. It's maybe less smooth with respect to inferencing than the type synonym approach, but if there are benefits (e.g., type leakage) then we should discuss whether this approach would be better.",
