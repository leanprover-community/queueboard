I do not have anything agains your `WithAbs` approach, but if a unified one can be used for both the archimedean and the non-archimedean situation, that would be preferable.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me that it helps to think about `v`-adic valuations as discrete integer-valued multiplicative valuations, instead of real absolute values, since e.g. then we don't need to make a choice of base (probably there are better reasons!). But, since this is not possible for the infinite places, to fully unify them we could turn a `v`-adic valuation into a `v`-adic absolute value, then we might use `AbsoluteValue.completion` for both the finite and infinite places. But that sounds like a lot of refactoring for the `adicCompletion` API, and I imagine there's a lot of material from the `Valued` API that is made use of for `adicCompletion` and is not available for `AbsoluteValue`.

Forget my suggestion to use `Valuation`. But I guess that the main point we were trying to make with @riccardobrasca is that in the same vein as [Valued.mk'](https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/Mathlib/Topology/Algebra/Valued/ValuationTopology.html#Valued.mk') associates a valued structure to a Valuation, it seems that simply creating a `NormedRing.mk` that takes an absolute value and creates a normed ring might be a good solution. At least, it works very well in the nonarchimedean setting, _mutatis mutandis._ The rest of your PR would be hardly modified, I guess.",

In the latest commit I have done the following:\r\n- Defined `def normedField` inside the `AbsoluteValue` namespace in a separate file that takes an `AbsoluteValue` and returns a `NormedField` class -- I think this is neater and makes the `NormedField` construction available for other usage, so thanks for the suggestion @riccardobrasca !\r\n- Removed the `NormedRing` and `NormOneClass` instances. I did not replace these with `def` versions in the `AbsoluteValue` namespace, because I realised I don't actually need them. Let me know if you think I should add them anyway for completeness -- I guess `NormedRing` is the lowest possible level for `AbsoluteValue`.\r\n- I have kept the usage of `WithAbs` and included a paragraph in the documentation to explain a bit about this approach. If we remove it then we will need to use `@` (like the [non-Archimedean case](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/blob/6dcd0d943385f315b956fc76968c842a3ad4072c/Mathlib/RingTheory/DedekindDomain/AdicValuation.lean#L365)) or `letI := ...`, which I had in the old PR.

              "body": "> On top of all my previous comments, I have been thinking that perhaps another solution instead of your type alias would be to define a structure (probably not upgraded to a class, but I would expand on this at a later stage) `WithAbsRing` with two fields: a ring and an absolute value on it. Have you tried this idea? I think it would make your life easier both when trying to construct a sub-WithAbsRing from a given one; and when constructing a `WithAbsRing` from an infinite place, by doing `WithAbsRing.mk K v.1` (for `K` the field and `v` the infinite place). All your duplicated code with the `inferInstanceAs` would be automatically OK, once you prove your results (like those about an absolute value that factors through a complex embedding), and attach to an infinite place a term of this structure as above.\r\n> \r\n\r\nI'm not sure if this is what you had in mind, but I tried this as the following\r\n```\r\nstructure AbsoluteValued (R S : Type*) [Semiring R] [OrderedSemiring S]\r\n    where\r\n  abs : AbsoluteValue R S\r\n  value : R\r\n```\r\nBut it's not clear to me where to go from here with such a structure. I think `class` might be better because it should extend `Semiring` and `NormedField`, so that it has access to these instances I think? I have not interacted much with `structure` so this is probably my ignorance at play here. \r\n\r\nI think it might be helpful to make a more concrete analogy to the non-Archimedean case to clarify the options here. In the non-Archimedean case we want to use the [`Valued`](https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/Mathlib/Topology/Algebra/Valued/ValuationTopology.html#Valued) class which carries the `UniformSpace` structure we are interested in, but this has a distinguished valuation whereas we have multiple valuations. So there is a constructor [`Valued.mk'`](https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/Mathlib/Topology/Algebra/Valued/ValuationTopology.html#Valued.mk') which constructs the `Valued` instance when there is no preferred valuation/uniform structure. Then a `def` is made for [`adicValued`](https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/Mathlib/RingTheory/DedekindDomain/AdicValuation.html#IsDedekindDomain.HeightOneSpectrum.adicValued) which carries these `Valued` instances. In particular, [`adicCompletion`](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/blob/3ca1060d7e48260d1b1b7a0733f887e455455226/Mathlib/RingTheory/DedekindDomain/AdicValuation.lean#L365-L366) calls `adicValued.toUniformSpace` using the `@` operator.\r\n\r\nNow for the Archimedean case, the [`NormedField`](https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/Mathlib/Analysis/Normed/Field/Basic.html#NormedField) class plays the role of `Valued`. Again this has a distinguished norm, so we want a way of creating an instance for non-distinguished norms (or absolute values in this case). I think there are two main options here: (1) in analogy to non-Arch. case we create a `NormedField.mk'` constructor taking an absolute value and giving a `NormedField` instance, assign this to a `def`, then use `@` operators as appropriate; (2) create a type synonym that depends on absolute values, in order to assign the `NormedField` instance as in this PR. It's not clear to me where a new structure fits in to these options. \r\n\r\nBy the way, I did not realise this but those `inferInstanceAs` can actually just be deleted with the type synonym approach as well (except for `Coe` I think).\r\n\r\n> Perhaps a word about why \"type synonyms\" are raising so much scepticism: there is nothing inherently bad with them, and there are very high chances that your solution is excellent. Nevertheless, they are seldom used in the library, whereas bundling things through `structures` appears everywhere. I have the feeling that your guiding principle here is not really \"create another copy of `R` that I want to call something else than `Ring` for whatever reason\"; rather, to bundle together the underlying ring and an absolute value on it, and we're used to do so with structures. Clearly, \"we're used to...\" is a social thing, and I would be very happy to be convinced that in this case your suggestion is far better; on the other hand, surfing the wave and benefitting of all the infrastructure built around structures (pun not intended) could be useful.\r\n> \r\nI agree with a previous comment that the use of \"equip\" is misleading in the documentation, and I can see where the scepticism is coming from! My guiding principle for using a type synonym is less about \"equipping\" the ring with an absolute value, but really more about providing a mechanism for type class inferencing to handle non-preferential instances without using the `@` operator. So actually I do want to create another copy of a ring, but one that explicitly depends on an absolute value, so that I can sensibly assign instances that depend on absolute values to it. I think I'm arguing that the `NormedField` and `Valued` classes provide the \"bundling\" mechanisms, and the `Valued.mk'` and `WithAbs` are two different ways of making that bundling mechanism non-preferential. There is at least some precedence for doing this with type synonyms in [WithLp](https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/Mathlib/Analysis/Normed/Lp/WithLp.html#The-WithLp-type-synonym), which does something very similar for the $L^p$ norm -- maybe it would be helpful to separate `WithAbs` into a more developed API like this?",

Actually, in my original approach in #13577  I used the model of [`Valued`](https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/Mathlib/Topology/Algebra/Valued/ValuationTopology.html#Valued) and [`HeightOneSpectrum.adicCompletion`](https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/Mathlib/RingTheory/DedekindDomain/AdicValuation.html#IsDedekindDomain.HeightOneSpectrum.adicCompletion). This worked fine, but then I needed to use either lots of `@`s or `letI := v.normedField`s everywhere to explicitly tell the system which uniform space structure I needed. The type synonym approach of `WithAbs` lets the inference system take care of this, so it seems a bit neater to me, but we can keep `WithAbs` and its instances while abstracting the `normedRing` definitions to an `AbsoluteValue` file/namespace as you suggest. I will take a look!",

I do not have anything agains your `WithAbs` approach, but if a unified one can be used for both the archimedean and the non-archimedean situation, that would be preferable.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me that it helps to think about `v`-adic valuations as discrete integer-valued multiplicative valuations, instead of real absolute values, since e.g. then we don't need to make a choice of base (probably there are better reasons!). But, since this is not possible for the infinite places, to fully unify them we could turn a `v`-adic valuation into a `v`-adic absolute value, then we might use `AbsoluteValue.completion` for both the finite and infinite places. But that sounds like a lot of refactoring for the `adicCompletion` API, and I imagine there's a lot of material from the `Valued` API that is made use of for `adicCompletion` and is not available for `AbsoluteValue`.

It is possible to do this without `WithAbs` and using only `(v : AbsoluteValue R ℝ)`. Then we might have something like `def AbsoluteValue.normedField : NormedField K ...`. This is similar to my original approach in #13577. In that case then we either need to use lots of `letI := v.normedField` or `@`s to tell the inference system which uniform space instances we mean (at least for the `AbsoluteValue` completion part). The type synonym approach of `WithAbs` allows the inference system take care of this, so it seems a bit neater to me, although I'm happy to discuss further!\r\n> \r\n> Well, we certainly prefer neat code ;-) So I'd like to understand better if your `@` business can be avoided by some fine use of the tools at our disposal, of there is really something deep going on. I do not have anything agains your `WithAbs` approach, but if a unified one can be used for both the archimedean and the non-archimedean situation, that would be preferable.\r\n\r\nOh no, you're right. Forget my suggestion to use `Valuation`. But I guess that the main point we were trying to make with @riccardobrasca is that in the same vein as [Valued.mk'](https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/Mathlib/Topology/Algebra/Valued/ValuationTopology.html#Valued.mk') associates a valued structure to a Valuation, it seems that simply creating a `NormedRing.mk` that takes an absolute value and creates a normed ring might be a good solution. At least, it works very well in the nonarchimedean setting, _mutatis mutandis._ The rest of your PR would be hardly modified, I guess.",

In the latest commit I have done the following:\r\n- Defined `def normedField` inside the `AbsoluteValue` namespace in a separate file that takes an `AbsoluteValue` and returns a `NormedField` class -- I think this is neater and makes the `NormedField` construction available for other usage, so thanks for the suggestion @riccardobrasca !\r\n- Removed the `NormedRing` and `NormOneClass` instances. I did not replace these with `def` versions in the `AbsoluteValue` namespace, because I realised I don't actually need them.

I think `class` might be better because it should extend `Semiring` and `NormedField`, so that it has access to these instances I think? I have not interacted much with `structure` so this is probably my ignorance at play here. \r\n\r\nI think it might be helpful to make a more concrete analogy to the non-Archimedean case to clarify the options here. In the non-Archimedean case we want to use the [`Valued`](https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/Mathlib/Topology/Algebra/Valued/ValuationTopology.html#Valued) class which carries the `UniformSpace` structure we are interested in, but this has a distinguished valuation whereas we have multiple valuations. So there is a constructor [`Valued.mk'`](https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/Mathlib/Topology/Algebra/Valued/ValuationTopology.html#Valued.mk') which constructs the `Valued` instance when there is no preferred valuation/uniform structure. Then a `def` is made for [`adicValued`](https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/Mathlib/RingTheory/DedekindDomain/AdicValuation.html#IsDedekindDomain.HeightOneSpectrum.adicValued) which carries these `Valued` instances. In particular, [`adicCompletion`](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/blob/3ca1060d7e48260d1b1b7a0733f887e455455226/Mathlib/RingTheory/DedekindDomain/AdicValuation.lean#L365-L366) calls `adicValued.toUniformSpace` using the `@` operator.\r\n\r\nNow for the Archimedean case, the [`NormedField`](https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/Mathlib/Analysis/Normed/Field/Basic.html#NormedField) class plays the role of `Valued`. Again this has a distinguished norm, so we want a way of creating an instance for non-distinguished norms (or absolute values in this case). I think there are two main options here: (1) in analogy to non-Arch. case we create a `NormedField.mk'` constructor taking an absolute value and giving a `NormedField` instance, assign this to a `def`, then use `@` operators as appropriate; (2) create a type synonym that depends on absolute values, in order to assign the `NormedField` instance as in this PR. It's not clear to me where a new structure fits in to these options. \r\n\r\nBy the way, I did not realise this but those `inferInstanceAs` can actually just be deleted with the type synonym approach as well (except for `Coe` I think).\r\n\r\n> Perhaps a word about why \"type synonyms\" are raising so much scepticism: there is nothing inherently bad with them, and there are very high chances that your solution is excellent. Nevertheless, they are seldom used in the library, whereas bundling things through `structures` appears everywhere.

My guiding principle for using a type synonym is less about \"equipping\" the ring with an absolute value, but really more about providing a mechanism for type class inferencing to handle non-preferential instances without using the `@` operator. So actually I do want to create another copy of a ring, but one that explicitly depends on an absolute value, so that I can sensibly assign instances that depend on absolute values to it. I think I'm arguing that the `NormedField` and `Valued` classes provide the \"bundling\" mechanisms, and the `Valued.mk'` and `WithAbs` are two different ways of making that bundling mechanism non-preferential. There is at least some precedence for doing this with type synonyms in [WithLp](https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/Mathlib/Analysis/Normed/Lp/WithLp.html#The-WithLp-type-synonym), which does something very similar for the $L^p$ norm -- maybe it would be helpful to separate `WithAbs` into a more developed API like this?",
