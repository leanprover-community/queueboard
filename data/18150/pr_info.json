The pattern is that I rename a declaration from `A` to `B`, then change declaration `C` (but do not rename it).

In your heuristic, `lemma C` should be completely new, not a modification of an existing one.  Anyway, the new script should handle this situation now.\r\n\r\nI also added a further feature: the script reports to stderr a summary of all the deprecations that it applied.  This is a hand-rolled `git diff`, but it might be convenient to have the summary.",
