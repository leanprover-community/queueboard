I find this version less intrusive to the original statement of FLT.\r\n\r\nThe relaxed 'unit' variant `FermatLastTheoremWith' α` states that any nonzero solution to Fermat equation $a^n+b^n=c^n$ should be units $(a, b, c)$ or their common multiples. The stronger original `FermatLastTheoremWith α` states that there is no nonzero solution $(a, b, c)$ from the beginning.\r\n\r\nFor `α = ℕ` or `ℤ` the two statements are equivalent to the original FLT. A purpose of this is to include a polynomial version of FLT which is easy to prove (relevant Zulip discussion [here](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/287929-mathlib4/topic/Mason-Stothers.20theorem.20and.20Polynomial.20FLT)). `FermatLastTheoremWith k[X]` is false for general field $k$, but `FermatLastTheoremWith' k[X]` is.\r\n \r\nI speculate that for some integral ring `α` over `ℤ`, the original statement of FLT is false while the suggested unit variant is true. For example, take the integral closure of $\\mathbb{Z}[w]$ where $w = (-1 + \\sqrt{3} i ) / 2$ is the 3rd root of unity satisfying $w^3 = 1$. The original statement for $n = 6k + 1$ is false as $w^n + (w^2)^n = (-1)^n$, but note that the solutions only consists of units.\r\n\r\n[![Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io/from-referrer/)\r\n",
