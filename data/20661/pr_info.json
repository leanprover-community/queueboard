        "body": " We prove several results involving partial sums of coefficients (or norm of coefficients) of  L-series. \r\n\r\nThe two main results of this PR are:\r\n\r\n- `LSeriesSummable_of_sum_norm_bigO`: for `f : ℕ → ℂ`, if the partial sums `∑ k ∈ Icc 1 n, ‖f k‖` are `O(n ^ r)` for some real `0 ≤ r`, then the L-series `Lseries f` converges at `s : ℂ` for all `s` such that `r < s.re`.\r\n\r\n- `LSeries_eq_mul_integral` : for `f : ℕ → ℂ`, if the partial sums `∑ k ∈ Icc 1 n, f k` are `O(n ^ r)` for some real `0 ≤ r` and the L-series `LSeries f` converges at `s : ℂ` with `r < s.re`, then `LSeries f s = s * ∫ t in Set.Ioi 1, (∑ k ∈ Icc 1 ⌊t⌋₊, f k) * t ^ (- (s + 1))`.\r\n\r\nMore results will be proved in #20660 \r\n\r\n---\r\n<!-- The text above the `---` will become the commit message when your\r\nPR is merged.

When I first started contributing to mathlib, I was told that `private` was banned entirely; the rules have been relaxed somewhat, but I think indiscriminate use of `private` is still discouraged.\r\n> \r\n> Many of these lemmas (not all, I admit) could potentially be useful elsewhere. Maybe they're not terribly interesting, but mathlib is full of dull-but-useful lemmas. Others have one-line proofs and are only used once in the file; so they can just be in-lined where used.\r\n\r\nYes, I know there are a lot of `private` results. I tried to keep the proof short (well, not too long) and thus added a lot of partial results (and it's even worse in the second PR). I'll try to clean it up a bit as you suggested by making some of them public and incorporating others in the proof. ",

When I first started contributing to mathlib, I was told that `private` was banned entirely; the rules have been relaxed somewhat, but I think indiscriminate use of `private` is still discouraged.\r\n\r\nMany of these lemmas (not all, I admit) could potentially be useful elsewhere. Maybe they're not terribly interesting, but mathlib is full of dull-but-useful lemmas. Others have one-line proofs and are only used once in the file; so they can just be in-lined where used.",
