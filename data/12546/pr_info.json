That is because Freiman homs don't have much structure and we do not study them under this angle.\r\n\r\nThis PR replaces the bundled homs by predicates and moves the file from `Algebra.Group.Freiman` to `Combinatorics.Additive.FreimanHom` so that:\r\n* It is clear these are combinatorial objects, not algebraic ones.\r\n* The diff isn't completely mangled. Nothing was kept so it's not worth comparing via a naïve git diff.\r\n\r\nAlso fix a few oddities accidentally introduced in #12701.\r\n\r\n---\r\n<!-- The text above the `---` will become the commit message when your\r\nPR is merged.

The sets `A` and `B` *are* the spaces, and not `α` and `β`, just as manifolds in R^n *are* the spaces rather than the ambient R^n.\n\nIn short, `IsMulFreimanHomOn` is an inappropriate name that does not reflect the mathematical reality.
