Just to be sure, do you agree that with your proposed change we are _losing_ the definition of the norm down to `Z` of an ideal in an arbitrary ring that is finite and torsion-free over the integers?\r\n\r\nYes. Currently the definition works from orders to `ℤ`, but not in the relative case (not even from `𝓞 L` to `𝓞 K`). What I am proposing doesn't work for orders, but works in the relative case. Of course we want both generalizations, but I think it is more reasonable to have this at the beginning (note that in practice this is only used from `𝓞 K` to `ℤ`).\r\n\r\nRemoving `IsIntegrallyClosed` (from `Algebra.intNorm`) is probably not very difficult, and once this is done it will automatically be removed from `spanNorm` (since it is a typeclass the linter will flag where it is not needed).",

Just to be sure, do you agree that with your proposed change we are _losing_ the definition of the norm down to `Z` of an ideal in an arbitrary ring that is finite and torsion-free over the integers?\r\n\r\nYes. Currently the definition works from orders to `ℤ`, but not in the relative case (not even from `𝓞 L` to `𝓞 K`). What I am proposing doesn't work for orders, but works in the relative case. Of course we want both generalizations, but I think it is more reasonable to have this at the beginning (note that in practice this is only used from `𝓞 K` to `ℤ`).\r\n\r\nRemoving `IsIntegrallyClosed` (from `Algebra.intNorm`) is probably not very difficult, and once this is done it will automatically be removed from `spanNorm` (since it is a typeclass the linter will flag where it is not needed).",
