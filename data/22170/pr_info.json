The issues with the calc code action are:\r\n1) it requires a valid calc syntax so writing calc is not enough. I\r\n   typically write calc _ to get the code action. But when you write\r\n   calc and there is already something below that could vaguely be\r\n   mistaken for a calc then the code action triggers and the replacement\r\n   swallows the following syntax.\r\n2) A code action is less visible than a TryThis (but this wouldn’t be\r\n   enough motivation for me without the previous point).\r\n\r\nAlso get rid of two `unreachable!` since experience show that those branches can be reached when handling malformed inputs, and the panic is awful for users.\r\n\r\n---\r\n<!-- The text above the `---` will become the commit message when your\r\nPR is merged.
