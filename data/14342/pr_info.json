Why don't you want it to be simply an assumption that you can add?\r\n\r\nThere are two main reasons that I want to make it a class.\r\n1.  When working with concrete examples such as $\\mathbb{C}_p/\\mathbb{Q}_p$, or an arbitrary finite extension of local fields, the type class inference can infer the instance for these canonical valuations automatically. (This is the main reason.)\r\n2. It expresses that vL is an extension of vK, so it is the setup for many definitions/theorems. For example, this can be the setup for higher ramification groups (the restriction of vL hardly equals vK due to normalization). Another example is that this can be used in the setup for Krasner's lemma, e.g. for $K^{alg}/K$ when $K$ is any rank one valued field. So making it a class saves explicit variables and enables notations like `G(vL/vK)^[u]`. (This is a relatively minor reason.)",

Do you have any suggestions on how to proceed?\r\n\r\nYes, I understand that `vR` is only determined up to equivalence, but the point of setting it up as an outParam is that lean will just use the first `vR` that it finds in the context of typeclass inference. So one would have to carefully select which instances of `IsValExtension` are actually implemented as instances, in the sense that you should not have `IsValExtension vR vA` instances for two different `vR`'s. In the p-adic case, we could choose some standard normalization and stick with it throughout the library.  Anyway, we can think about these design decisions further after this PR is merged.\r\n\r\nbors r+",

Why don't you want it to be simply an assumption that you can add?\r\n\r\nThere are two main reasons that I want to make it a class.\r\n1.  When working with concrete examples such as $\\mathbb{C}_p/\\mathbb{Q}_p$, or an arbitrary finite extension of local fields, the type class inference can infer the instance for these canonical valuations automatically. (This is the main reason.)\r\n2. It expresses that vL is an extension of vK, so it is the setup for many definitions/theorems. For example, this can be the setup for higher ramification groups (the restriction of vL hardly equals vK due to normalization). Another example is that this can be used in the setup for Krasner's lemma, e.g. for $K^{alg}/K$ when $K$ is any rank one valued field. So making it a class saves explicit variables and enables notations like `G(vL/vK)^[u]`. (This is a relatively minor reason.)",

I hope doing this would make some of the automation work better as well.\r\n\r\nThank you for your advice @adamtopaz . I have discussed with @faenuccio about this possible improvement but we’ve encountered an obstacle. The issue is that `vR` is only determined up to equivalent classes, even by `R`, `A` and `vA` together.\r\n\r\nFor example, when `R` is $$\\mathbb{Q}_p$$, `A` is any finite extension of `R` with the discrete valuation,  we still have many choices of valuations `vR` satisfies `[IsValExtension vR vA]` e.g. The p-adic valuation sending `R` to `ℤₘ₀`, the p-adic valuation to `NNReal`, or the valuation sending $$p$$ to `(.ofAdd -n) : ℤₘ₀` instead of `(.ofAdd -1) : ℤₘ₀`.\r\n\r\nSo this `vR` and thus the target of the simp lemma cannot be determined until we explicitly fill in what `vR` is. Do you have any suggestions on how to proceed?",
