The structure of GroupTheory/GroupAction/Basic.lean is now:\r\n    - `namespace MulAction` (monoid action)\r\n        - `section Orbit`\r\n        - `section FixedPoints`\r\n        - `section Stabilizers`\r\n    - a standalone theorem\r\n    - `namespace MulAction` (group action)\r\n        - `section Orbit`\r\n        - `section Stabilizers`\r\n    - `namespace AddAction` (additive group action)\r\n1. The namespaces `MulAction.Stabilizer` and `AddAction.Stabilizer` were unnecessary and confusing, as it contained `submonoid` but not the group-action counterpart `stabilizer`.\r\n1. The changes to the other files are caused by variables being made implicit.\r\n\r\n<!-- The text above the `---` will become the commit message when your\r\nPR is merged.
