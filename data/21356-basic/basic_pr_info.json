Naturally, `Affine.lean` and `Group.lean` will be refactored in a similar fashion.\r\n\r\n- Refactor `Affine.lean` and `Group.lean` into `Affine/Basic.lean` (API for equations and nonsingularity), `Affine/Formula.lean` (formulae for group operations), and `Affine/Point.lean` (API for points and the group law)\r\n\r\nNote that material on the coordinate ring will very likely be refactored to another file `Affine/Universal.lean` in the near future, since this PR is large enough already. The other files are handled in other PRs.\r\n\r\n- #22545 splits `Jacobian.lean` into `Jacobian/Basic.lean` (API for weighted triples, equations, and nonsingularity), `Jacobian/Formula.lean` (formulae for group operations), and `Jacobian/Point.lean` (API for points and the group law)\r\n- #22549 splits `Projective.lean` into `Projective/Basic.lean` (API for unweighted triples, equations, and nonsingularity), `Projective/Formula.lean` (formulae for group operations), and `Projective/Point.lean` (API for points and the group law)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<!-- The text above the `---` will become the commit message when your\r\nPR is merged.

Before requesting review, can you split this into smaller pieces, for instance:\r\n- one PR splitting Affine.lean\r\n- another PR splitting Projective.lean\r\n- a third PR for Group.lean\r\n- another PR renaming the variables in Weierstrass.lean (which could already be made now, right?)\r\n- make all the porting note changes later - as I find it **much** easier to review \"simple code motion, yup\" than \"code motion plus a number of subtle changes which I then have to find by hand\".",
