        "body": "The files `Jacobian.lean` and `Projective.lean` are getting too long, and are expecting even more code in the near future, so I believe this is a good time to split them. Naturally, `Affine.lean` and `Group.lean` will be split in a similar fashion.\r\n\r\n- Split `Affine.lean` into `Affine/Basic.lean` (API for equations and nonsingularity), `Affine/Formula.lean` (formulae for group operations), and `Affine/Point.lean` (API for points and the group law)\r\n- Split `Jacobian.lean` into `Jacobian/Basic.lean` (API for weighted triples, equations, and nonsingularity), `Jacobian/Formula.lean` (formulae for group operations), and `Jacobian/Point.lean` (API for points and the group law)\r\n- Split `Projective.lean` into `Projective/Basic.lean` (API for unweighted triples, equations, and nonsingularity), `Projective/Formula.lean` (formulae for group operations), and `Projective/Point.lean` (group law on points)\r\n- Move the contents of `Group.lean` into `Affine/Point.lean` (material on the coordinate ring will very likely be refactored to another file `Affine/Universal.lean` in the near future, since this PR is large enough already)\r\n- Remove some `erw` and redundant porting notes.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<!-- The text above the `---` will become the commit message when your\r\nPR is merged.
