              "body": "@AlexBrodbelt, I have the impression that you have quite a few tricks yet to learn about writing analysis arguments in Lean.  As an example, I have pushed an efficient proof of your first lemma.\r\n\r\nThe \"Archive\" is for high quality proofs that, while being mathematical \"leaf theories\", show off the automation and libraries developed in Mathlib.  At the moment this proof is quite far from being this kind of showcase.  If you want to work on getting this proof to that level, it will take a lot of back-and-forth, and this may proceed rather slowly, depending on reviewers' availability to point out inefficiencies.\r\n\r\nIf you just want to make this proof available in a public repository for the community to use, you might consider instead contributing it to https://github.com/dwrensha/compfiles.  Are you aware of that project?",

Much the same applies if the statement is of the form `h → p`: move the hypotheses `h` before the colon rather than having an implication on the right hand side of the colon.\r\n* Standard indentation of the proof body is two columns, not four.\r\n\r\nSpecific remark about this lemma: it's essentially a combination of the existing lemmas `sdiff_singleton_eq_erase`, `Ico_erase_left` and `Ico_succ_left`. That should allow a much shorter proof. It might then be reasonable to inline that at the point where this lemma is needed.",

As an example, I have pushed an efficient proof of your first lemma.\r\n\r\nThe \"Archive\" is for high quality proofs that, while being mathematical \"leaf theories\", show off the automation and libraries developed in Mathlib.  At the moment this proof is quite far from being this kind of showcase.  If you want to work on getting this proof to that level, it will take a lot of back-and-forth, and this may proceed rather slowly, depending on reviewers' availability to point out inefficiencies.\r\n\r\nIf you just want to make this proof available in a public repository for the community to use, you might consider instead contributing it to https://github.com/dwrensha/compfiles.  Are you aware of that project?",
