In fact I don't need the two `Flat` lemmas either, because I can go directly from `closure` to `Spanning`. Once you add `Simple` and `Loopless` to mathlib I'd be happy to include these instances and golf these lemmas, maybe in a future PR. However notice that we're talking about the matroid on a singleton type where `Set.univ` is independent, which is the `freeOn` matroid. Is there a typeclass for that?\r\n> \r\n> No, but perhaps there should be. It would be `RankZero M✶`, where `RankZero` is the negation of what is currently called`RkPos`.\r\n\r\nAnd I hadn't noticed the `Subsingleton` part - those lemmas make sense now, and aren't to do with simplicity/looplessness as I'd thought. Sorry for the noise! ",
