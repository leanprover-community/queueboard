Add some API lemmas and trivial results about `trdeg`, e.g. that injective/surjective AlgHoms induce inequalities between `trdeg`s, and AlgEquivs induce equalities.\r\n\r\nIn **AlgebraicIndependent/TranscendenceBasis.lean**, we show:\r\n\r\n+ The AlgebraicIndependent sets in a domain form a Matroid, which is used to show all transcendence bases have the same cardinality. Provide algebraic characterizations of the matroid notions `Indep`, `Base`, `cRank`, `Basis`, `closure`, `Flat`, and `Spanning`.\r\n\r\n+ Transcendence bases are exactly algebraic independent families that are spanning (i.e. the whole algebra is algebraic over the algebra generated by the family). On the other hand, a spanning set in a domain contains a transcendence basis.\r\n\r\n+ There always exists an transcendence basis between an arbitrary AlgebraicIndependent set and an \"almost generating\" set in a domain.\r\n\r\n+ `trdeg R S + trdeg S A = trdeg R A` in a domain, which depends on `AlgebraicIndependent/IsTranscendenceBasis.sumElim_comp`.\r\n\r\n+ A finite AlgebraicIndependent family or spanning family in a domain that has the same cardinality as `trdeg` must be a transcendence basis.\r\n\r\nIn **AlgebraicIndependent/Transcendental.lean**: add API lemmas and show the inequality `trdeg R S + trdeg S A ≤ trdeg R A` (which does not require a domain).\r\n\r\nIn **AlgebraicIndependent/Defs.lean**: add Stacks tags and some trivial API lemmas about IsTranscendenceBasis.\r\n\r\nThanks to Chris Hughes and Jz Pan for preliminary works and Peter Nelson for the hint about Finitary and IndepMatroid.\r\n\r\nTODO:\r\n\r\n+ [The analogue of StrongRankCondition](https://mathoverflow.net/a/484564) in the setting of algebras, which implies `trdeg R (MvPolynomial (Fin n) R) = n` for all Nontrivial CommRing R.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n- [x] depends on: #20888\r\n- [x] depends on: #21512\r\n- [x] depends on: #21566\r\n\r\n<!-- The text above the `---` will become the commit message when your\r\nPR is merged.

The weak order is quite poorly behaved, but I don't see a reason this couldn't be an interesting object. And it would mean all matroids have a representation of some type.\n\n ",
