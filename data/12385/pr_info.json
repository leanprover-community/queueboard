I'm okay with removing them.\r\n- the new API doesn't match very well the existing one, but after way more time that I'm willing to admit I came to the conclusion that it doesn't make sense to make it better without reorganizing and splitting the whole file.\r\n\r\n---\r\n<!-- The text above the `---` will become the commit message when your\r\nPR is merged.
