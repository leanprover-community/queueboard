For example I think a countably infinite PiTensorProduct of 1-dimensional vector spaces over the rationals or reals is uncountably infinite-dimensional, because e.g. 1 tensor 1 tensor 1 tensor ... and 2 tensor 2 tensor 2 tensor ... are linearly independent (one is \"infinitely bigger than the other\"). What do you think?\r\n\r\nThat ... is an interesting argument. I think I would argue that _either_ we must be working over the extended reals, in which case there's something in the ring of the \"correct\" infinite size, _or_ the very fact that our ring doesn't have infinity in it implies that any such infinite product must \"really\" be an infinite limit and should be handled accordingly -- but I will freely admit I am confused on the point and I'm not sure that argument would go through in Lean.\r\n\r\nInstead, I will retreat to the direct categorical argument. Let $A_1, A_2, B$ be $R$-algebras, then we can define the tensor product with a universal property: there exist canonical injections $\\iota_1: A_1 \\to A\\otimes B$ and $\\iota_2: A_2 \\to A\\otimes B$ s.t. for all $B$ and for any $f:A_1 \\to B, g:A_2\\to B$ whose images in $B$ commute, there exists a unique lift $h:A_1 \\otimes A_2 \\to B$ s.t. $h\\circ\\iota_1 = f$ and $h\\circ\\iota_2 = g$. (We have this in Mathlib as [Algebra.TensorProduct.liftEquiv](https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/Mathlib/RingTheory/TensorProduct/Basic.html#Algebra.TensorProduct.liftEquiv).) But the universal property of the coproduct is precisely the same, except without the requirement that the images commute. Thus if the category consists only of commutative $R$-algebras, every lifted map induced by the tensor product is isomorphic to the corresponding lift by the coproduct and vice versa, thus the binary tensor product coincides with the binary coproduct, and in particular this is true of the category $R\\mathbf{\\text{-}CAlg}$ itself. \r\n\r\nI am unsure how well this argument extends to arbitrarily infinite index sets, but it should certainly extend as far as countably infinite sets at least. \r\n\r\n(Also this appears to be a Standard Category Theory Result, but of course in a case like this I prefer proofs by something other than authority :p)",

That seems more like a \"feat\".\r\n\r\nI mean, it can be a 'feat' if you want it to be! The biggest effect of this PR IMO is that there are now a bunch of lemmas that are spelled `asPowers.foo` instead of `foo_asPowers`, so I think of it as a 'refactor'; there's not much mathematical content, it's just providing different access to an equivalent formulation, plus a bunch of usability stuff like simp annotations.

I think PiTensorProduct is much too big to be the coproduct if the indexing set is infinite. For example I think a countably infinite PiTensorProduct of 1-dimensional vector spaces over the rationals or reals is uncountably infinite-dimensional, because e.g. 1 tensor 1 tensor 1 tensor ... and 2 tensor 2 tensor 2 tensor ... are linearly independent (one is \"infinitely bigger than the other\"). What do you think?",

              "body": "> Just looking at the module docstring of this file -- it claims that in the category of commutative R -algebras, the coproduct is just `PiTensorProduct`. I think PiTensorProduct is much too big to be the coproduct if the indexing set is infinite. For example I think a countably infinite PiTensorProduct of 1-dimensional vector spaces over the rationals or reals is uncountably infinite-dimensional, because e.g. 1 tensor 1 tensor 1 tensor ... and 2 tensor 2 tensor 2 tensor ... are linearly independent (one is \"infinitely bigger than the other\"). What do you think?\r\n\r\nThat ... is an interesting argument. I think I would argue that _either_ we must be working over the extended reals, in which case there's something in the ring of the \"correct\" infinite size, _or_ the very fact that our ring doesn't have infinity in it implies that any such infinite product must \"really\" be an infinite limit and should be handled accordingly -- but I will freely admit I am confused on the point and I'm not sure that argument would go through in Lean.\r\n\r\nInstead, I will retreat to the direct categorical argument. Let $A_1, A_2, B$ be $R$-algebras, then we can define the tensor product with a universal property: there exist canonical injections $\\iota_1: A_1 \\to A\\otimes B$ and $\\iota_2: A_2 \\to A\\otimes B$ s.t. for all $B$ and for any $f:A_1 \\to B, g:A_2\\to B$ whose images in $B$ commute, there exists a unique lift $h:A_1 \\otimes A_2 \\to B$ s.t. $h\\circ\\iota_1 = f$ and $h\\circ\\iota_2 = g$. (We have this in Mathlib as [Algebra.TensorProduct.liftEquiv](https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/Mathlib/RingTheory/TensorProduct/Basic.html#Algebra.TensorProduct.liftEquiv).) But the universal property of the coproduct is precisely the same, except without the requirement that the images commute. Thus if the category consists only of commutative $R$-algebras, every lifted map induced by the tensor product is isomorphic to the corresponding lift by the coproduct and vice versa, thus the binary tensor product coincides with the binary coproduct, and in particular this is true of the category $R\\mathbf{\\text{-}CAlg}$ itself. \r\n\r\nI am unsure how well this argument extends to arbitrarily infinite index sets, but it should certainly extend as far as countably infinite sets at least. \r\n\r\n(Also this appears to be a Standard Category Theory Result, but of course in a case like this I prefer proofs by something other than authority :p)",

The biggest effect of this PR IMO is that there are now a bunch of lemmas that are spelled `asPowers.foo` instead of `foo_asPowers`, so I think of it as a 'refactor'; there's not much mathematical content, it's just providing different access to an equivalent formulation, plus a bunch of usability stuff like simp annotations.
