That being said, I am not an official reviewer or maintainer, so please take this opinion with a pinch of salt. ",

Then add your two theorems (which you can in the respective file). add and commit that. Then `git push --force origin finset_nontrivial_two_theorems_add`\r\n\r\nI am so so sorry.

That being said, I am not an official reviewer or maintainer, so please take this opinion with a pinch of salt. ",
