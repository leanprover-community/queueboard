No lemma is removed, and all lemma statements remain the same.\r\n\r\nI do not change the name `Subfield` to `SubdivisionRing` as this kind of name abuse is accepted practice in mathlib, and since a division ring is also called a skew field.\r\n\r\nAlso generalizes `RingHom.eqLocus(Field)` slightly.\r\n\r\n---\r\n<!-- The text above the `---` will become the commit message when your\r\nPR is merged.

              "body": "Indeed this is super similar to the work you've already done 2 years ago! @jcommelin thought it should be named `Subdivisionring` (or `SubdivisionRing`?) but changing the name would require fixing a lot of files, or maybe we can make an alias / abbrev Subfield for the commutative case, which would also make it less awkward for most of the people who will only work with fields.\r\n\r\nGeneralizing `IntermediateField` is a good idea too, as (maximal) subfields in central simple algebras (e.g. quaternion algebras) are important in number theory, for example. However, ~~this only warrant a generalization to IntermediateFields between a Field and a DivisionRing, not two DivisionRings~~ (Edit: generalizing to two DivisionRings isn't immediately possible, because of the `Algebra` typeclass involved), and we probably want to bake in commutativity, so maybe a dedicated type for maximal subfields is more appropriate. On the other hand, people do study extension of division rings and even their Galois theory, and a fully generalized IntermediateField might be more applicable in that case. I would be happy to see the generalization done in another PR, and hopefully it only incurs minimal changes.",

However, ~~this only warrant a generalization to IntermediateFields between a Field and a DivisionRing, not two DivisionRings~~ (Edit: generalizing to two DivisionRings isn't immediately possible, because of the `Algebra` typeclass involved), and we probably want to bake in commutativity, so maybe a dedicated type for maximal subfields is more appropriate. On the other hand, people do study extension of division rings and even their Galois theory, and a fully generalized IntermediateField might be more applicable in that case. I would be happy to see the generalization done in another PR, and hopefully it only incurs minimal changes.",
