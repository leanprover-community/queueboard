To my knowledge, there is a bunch of ancillary notions and constructions associated to that of maximal ideal (localization, residue field, maximal spectrum, etc.) whereas maximal subgroup are \"only\" `CoAtoms` among subgroups: certainly there are many results about them but I feel that they fewer things are \"built out of them\". I am sure @AntoineChambert-Loir will promptly prove me wrong, given his knowledge, but if I happen to be correct I would argue that keeping around the assumption `IsCoatom` (or simply introducing an `abbrev` and living with `defeq`) should be ok, and I would suggest to remove from this PR the boilerplate pertaining to maximal subgroups.\r\n>\r\n>-- \r\n>Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub:\r\n>https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/20499#discussion_r1916115873\r\n>You are receiving this because you were mentioned.\r\n>\r\n>Message ID: ***@***.***>",

In a sense, the `def` at play here is `IsCoatom` and it is for that one that we should build the API and use that instead of the `def`. If then something is an `abbrev` of `IsCoatom` we will use the API there and that will be helping avoiding `defeq` abuse. Of course 3. is also OK, but I think that is mathematically pleasant to call a maximal ideal/subgroup as such rather than a \"coatomic ideal\".\r\n\r\nIf we all agree (@AntoineChambert-Loir : what's your take on the matter?), shall we start by this PR and simply rely on the `IsCoatom` API (perhaps explaining in the doc what is going on, possibly pointing to this discussion)?",

I am sure @AntoineChambert-Loir will promptly prove me wrong, given his knowledge, but if I happen to be correct I would argue that keeping around the assumption `IsCoatom` (or simply introducing an `abbrev` and living with `defeq`) should be ok, and I would suggest to remove from this PR the boilerplate pertaining to maximal subgroups.",

To my knowledge, there is a bunch of ancillary notions and constructions associated to that of maximal ideal (localization, residue field, maximal spectrum, etc.) whereas maximal subgroup are \"only\" `CoAtoms` among subgroups: certainly there are many results about them but I feel that they fewer things are \"built out of them\". I am sure @AntoineChambert-Loir will promptly prove me wrong, given his knowledge, but if I happen to be correct I would argue that keeping around the assumption `IsCoatom` (or simply introducing an `abbrev` and living with `defeq`) should be ok, and I would suggest to remove from this PR the boilerplate pertaining to maximal subgroups.\r\n>\r\n>-- \r\n>Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub:\r\n>https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/20499#discussion_r1916115873\r\n>You are receiving this because you were mentioned.\r\n>\r\n>Message ID: ***@***.***>",
