        "body": "Define ordinal approximants for the least/greatest fixed points of a monotone function in a complete lattice. It is sometimes also called the constructive Knaster-Tarski Theorem, first introduced by Cousot & Cousot in 1979. This implementation is however not constructive.\r\n\r\nThis has a variety of applications in non standard logics and proofs such as quantitative logics or cyclic proofs.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nI am a bit unsure about the placement of certain theorems, namely:\r\n-  The placement of the `limitation` definition and its theorems. This feels very special to this theorem. Thus I left it in this file. It could however also live somewhere in Ordinals/Cardinals\r\n- The theorems `monotone_stabilizing` and  `antitone_stabilizing`. I first thought about placing them in `Mathlib.Order.Monotone.Basic`. However, `Monotone` is using preorders and not partialorders, where this theorem does not hold. Maybe this theorem is also already proven somewhere else and I missed it?\r\n- The `OrdinalApprox` namespace could also live in `Mathlib.Order.FixedPoints`. However, I decided aginst it as this would mean that importing `Mathlib.Order.FixedPoints` would also import a lot of (likely unecessary) files from `Mathlib.SetTheory.Ordinal` and `Mathlib.SetTheory.Cardinal` when not using ordinal approximants.\r\n\r\nI appreciate comments regarding these questions and reviews in general. I also appreciate a comment if this has already been done and I just totally missed it.\r\n\r\n[![Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io/from-referrer/)\r\n",

Lemma 1 from [Echenique2005], I believe? So please update the PR title/description + module doc + docstrings to reflect that.",

However, when trying to adapt it, some problems occurred to me there.\r\n- There are multiple ways to formalize it, which behave differently:\r\n  1.   `| 0 => x | Succ a => f (approx f x a) | limit A => sSup A`\r\n     This formalization still satisfies `lfpApprox_add_one`, but not `lfpApprox_monotone`\r\n  2. `sSup ({ f (lfpApprox x b) | (b : Ordinal) (h : b < a) } ∪ {x}`\r\n     This formalization still satisfies `lfpApprox_monotone`, but not `lfpApprox_add_one`\r\n \r\n  I'd argue that the person who formalizes approximation schemes for the next fixed points should decide how to formalize it. \r\n- Since not both `lfpApprox_add_one` and `lfpApprox_monotone` holds at the same time, nearly all other proofs will not work. I am also not sure, which condition is required for either of the formalizations to hold again (but probably the existence of a next fixed point). Then I feel like this parameter could be misleading as it suggests existence of theorems involving it. \r\n\r\nThat's why I would opt to not include the extra argument in the current PR.",
