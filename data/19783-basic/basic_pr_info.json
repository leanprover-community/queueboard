Perhaps it would be worth adding a definition `charFun P hL w` to refer to the integral of `probChar` for the standard choice of `e = probFourierChar` (which I want to rename to `Circle.expAddChar`, see my previous comments) ? We also probably want another definition that chooses L for special cases, but we can keep that for future PRs.\r\n\r\nI added a definition of `charFun P hL w`. I renamed the previous extensionality result and added a new theorem `ext_of_charFun_eq`. The latter is now used to show that `complexMGF` separates measures.",
