Is there a discussion recorded somewhere with the pros and cons and the reason for going with a function valued in `WithTop (WithBot _)`?\r\n\r\nNo I have checked the streams on Zulip and I don't think there is any recorded discussion on that. The reason why we use `WithTop (WithBot _)` is that we eventually want `⊥ + ⊺ = ⊥`. It is true that for topological spaces `X` and `Y`, `dim(X × Y) = dim(X) + dim(Y)`. Now if `X` is empty and `Y` is infinite-dimensional, then `X × Y` is also empty. So we have `⊥ + ⊺ = dim(X) + dim(Y) = dim(X × Y) = ⊥`.",

The length of a module can be defined as krull dimension of the poset submodules; the length of a composition series; the krull dimension of `covby` relation. But the last is conceptually the same as length of the composition series. So probably `krullDimOfRel` is not too useful a definition so I think we should remove it. ",

Is there a discussion recorded somewhere with the pros and cons and the reason for going with a function valued in `WithTop (WithBot _)`?\r\n\r\nNo I have checked the streams on Zulip and I don't think there is any recorded discussion on that. The reason why we use `WithTop (WithBot _)` is that we eventually want `⊥ + ⊺ = ⊥`. It is true that for topological spaces `X` and `Y`, `dim(X × Y) = dim(X) + dim(Y)`. Now if `X` is empty and `Y` is infinite-dimensional, then `X × Y` is also empty. So we have `⊥ + ⊺ = dim(X) + dim(Y) = dim(X × Y) = ⊥`.",
