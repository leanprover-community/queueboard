              "body": "Let $V$ be a module over a ring $R$ and let $V^* = \\text{Hom}_R(V, R)$. Choose $x, y \\in V$ and $f, g \\in V^*$ such that $f(x) = g(y) = 2$. Then we can define the reflections $r_1, r_2 \\in GL(V)$ by $r_1(v) = v - f(v)x$ and $r_2(v) = v - g(v)y$ (see [Module.reflection](https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/Mathlib/LinearAlgebra/Reflection.html#Module.reflection)).\r\n\r\nOne of the important ingredients to defining a *reflection representation* of a Coxeter group (see my comment at the bottom of #11526) is having some formula for the power $(r_1 r_2)^m$. That formula is:\r\n$$(r_1 r_2)^m v = v - \\frac{2 T_m(t/2) - 2}{t - 2} (f(v) x + g(v) y) + \\frac{U_{m-1}(t/2) - U_{m-2} (t/2) - 1}{t - 2} g(x) f(v) y + \\frac{U_{m}(t/2) - U_{m-1} (t/2) - 1}{t - 2} f(y) g(v) x$$\r\nwhere $t = f(y) g(x) - 2$. This formula is messy, but it can be proved straightforwardly using induction. Also, all of the fractions in this formula are actually polynomials in $t$, so this formula works over any ring, which is important for defining crystallographic reflection representations.\r\n\r\nHowever, actually stating this formula for $m = 0$ (which had better be possible, because that is the base case of the induction) requires defining $U_{-2}$ and $U_{-1}$. And I figured that if I'm going to do that, I might as well define $U_n$ and $T_n$ for every integer $n$.",

The best you can do is\r\n`U R n = (oldU R ((n + 1).natAbs - 1)) * (n + 1).sign`, which is quite bad for doing any sort of proofs with.",

              "body": "Let $V$ be a module over a ring $R$ and let $V^* = \\text{Hom}_R(V, R)$. Choose $x, y \\in V$ and $f, g \\in V^*$ such that $f(x) = g(y) = 2$. Then we can define the reflections $r_1, r_2 \\in GL(V)$ by $r_1(v) = v - f(v)x$ and $r_2(v) = v - g(v)y$ (see [Module.reflection](https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/Mathlib/LinearAlgebra/Reflection.html#Module.reflection)).\r\n\r\nOne of the important ingredients to defining a *reflection representation* of a Coxeter group (see my comment at the bottom of #11526) is having some formula for the power $(r_1 r_2)^m$. That formula is:\r\n$$(r_1 r_2)^m v = v - \\frac{2 T_m(t/2) - 2}{t - 2} (f(v) x + g(v) y) + \\frac{U_{m-1}(t/2) - U_{m-2} (t/2) - 1}{t - 2} g(x) f(v) y + \\frac{U_{m}(t/2) - U_{m-1} (t/2) - 1}{t - 2} f(y) g(v) x$$\r\nwhere $t = f(y) g(x) - 2$. This formula is messy, but it can be proved straightforwardly using induction. Also, all of the fractions in this formula are actually polynomials in $t$, so this formula works over any ring, which is important for defining crystallographic reflection representations.\r\n\r\nHowever, actually stating this formula for $m = 0$ (which had better be possible, because that is the base case of the induction) requires defining $U_{-2}$ and $U_{-1}$. And I figured that if I'm going to do that, I might as well define $U_n$ and $T_n$ for every integer $n$.",
