        "body": "When dealing with the mixed space, a lot of results depend on whether the infinite place considered is real or is complex and thus are duplicated using the ending `apply_of_isReal` or `apply_of_isComplex` in their names. However, the spelling `apply_ofIsReal` or `apply_ofIsComplex` was also used for some results. \r\n\r\nThis PR attempts to fix this confusion using the following convention:\r\n- If the fact that the infinite place is real or complex comes from an additional hypothesis, use `apply_of_isReal`/`apply_of_isComplex`\r\n- If the fact that the infinite place is real or complex comes from a subtype, use `apply_isReal` / `apply_isComplex`\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n<!-- The text above the `---` will become the commit message when your\r\nPR is merged.
