        "body": "This PR is the first in a series that attempts to improve generality in the current API for matrix rank. \r\n\r\nAt the moment, for `A : Matrix m n R`, the term `A.rank` is only well-defined for `Fintype n` and `CommRing R`. This is because the definition is in terms of `MulVecLin`, which requires these typeclass assumptions. The `Fintype` assumption, especially, is a little unfortunate, since it necessitates unnecessary and column/row-asymmetric `Fintype` assumptions throughout the API, and makes it impossible to state the important lemma `rank_transpose` for infinite matrices. \r\n\r\nWe don't touch the current definition `Matrix.rank` directly here, but we introduce cardinal and ENat-valued notions of rank for infinite matrices, with basic API for monotonicity. The lemma `cRank_toNat_eq_rank` is a proof of concept - it shows that the current `Matrix.rank` could easily be redefined as `Matrix.rank A := (Matrix.cRank A).toNat` with a strict gain in generality, and no loss to the existing API. The plan is to do this, and thereby prove `rank_transpose` in greater generality, in coming PRs. \r\n\r\nThe definition `Matrix.eRank` is  also natural, since `Matrix.eRank_transpose` will be true, but `Matrix.cRank_transpose` will not. \r\n\r\n[Zulip thread](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/channel/144837-PR-reviews/topic/.2322226.20Infinite.20matrix.20rank)\r\n\r\n---\r\n<!-- The text above the `---` will become the commit message when your\r\nPR is merged.

I would guess those are straightforward, so I would prefer to see them as part of this PR.\r\n\r\nThis is now done. The `diagonal` and `one` lemmas needed some new API showing that families coming from `Pi.single` are linearly independent under appropriate conditions (the existing lemma `Pi.linearIndependent_single` is stated in terms of sigma-types and is cumbersome to use directly, and the simplified versions required finiteness so won't work for this). So I added those. \r\n\r\nI also generalized the two existing reindex/submatrix lemmas for `rank` to not require square matrices. The `Fintype` assumptions can't be removed with the current definition, but easily could if `rank` were redefined in terms of `cRank`. ",

I would guess those are straightforward, so I would prefer to see them as part of this PR.\r\n\r\nThis is now done. The `diagonal` and `one` lemmas needed some new API showing that families coming from `Pi.single` are linearly independent under appropriate conditions (the existing lemma `Pi.linearIndependent_single` is stated in terms of sigma-types and is cumbersome to use directly, and the simplified versions required finiteness so won't work for this). So I added those. \r\n\r\nI also generalized the two existing reindex/submatrix lemmas for `rank` to not require square matrices. The `Fintype` assumptions can't be removed with the current definition, but easily could if `rank` were redefined in terms of `cRank`. ",
