(Indeed, common advice when teaching Lean in some form is to turn off that option, as the first thing you're doing.) Living just in math-land, autoImplicit is always off, and having a warning on activating it makes sense.\r\n\r\nFrom a pragmatic view-point: I claim that mathlib reviewers would usually reject PRs adding that option. This linter just codifies this internal convention, saving reviewer time.",

I think all the beginners running into errors here (mathlib or otherwise) are people who _didn't type this_, and so this doesn't help them.\r\n\r\nIs this warning just intended to ensure we don't merge new `set_option autoImplicit true`s into mathlib?",

(Indeed, common advice when teaching Lean in some form is to turn off that option, as the first thing you're doing.) Living just in math-land, autoImplicit is always off, and having a warning on activating it makes sense.\r\n\r\nFrom a pragmatic view-point: I claim that mathlib reviewers would usually reject PRs adding that option. This linter just codifies this internal convention, saving reviewer time.",
