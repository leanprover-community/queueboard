I didn't know you were working on this, and was planning to work with PKU students to define group schemes as group objects in the category over a base scheme (with the cartesian monoidal structure). It seems mathlib doesn't have the Monoid instance on `X ⟶ M` if `M` is a monoid object (with cartesian product) and `X` is arbitrary. Do you also have group schemes in mind and do you plan to do anything about that? You did touch the cartesian file, but aren't adding much.\r\n\r\nFor elliptic curves we might need \"MulAction objects\" which are actually two objects `M` and `S` in a category equipped with a morphism `M × S ⟶ S` satisfying axioms, where `M` is a monoid/group object. I'm wondering whether we can use some automation to get the MulAction of `X ⟶ M` on `X ⟶ S`; I don't know whether the work of @adamtopaz [on Lawvere theory](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24T339nz9ik) is relevant here.\r\n\r\nThe next goal would be the anti-equivalence between the category of affine group schemes to [HopfAlgebraCat](https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/Mathlib/Algebra/Category/HopfAlgebraCat/Basic.html#HopfAlgebraCat), as Hopf algebras can be seen as cogroup objects (w.r.t. coproduct, i.e. tensor product) in the category of R-algebras. (On the other hand R-algebras can be seen as monoid objects in R-Mod w.r.t. tensor product, which is super confusing ...)",

              "body": "Thanks for the work! I didn't know you were working on this, and was planning to work with PKU students to define group schemes as group objects in the category over a base scheme (with the cartesian monoidal structure). It seems mathlib doesn't have the Monoid instance on `X ⟶ M` if `M` is a monoid object (with cartesian product) and `X` is arbitrary. Do you also have group schemes in mind and do you plan to do anything about that? You did touch the cartesian file, but aren't adding much.\r\n\r\nFor elliptic curves we might need \"MulAction objects\" which are actually two objects `M` and `S` in a category equipped with a morphism `M × S ⟶ S` satisfying axioms, where `M` is a monoid/group object. I'm wondering whether we can use some automation to get the MulAction of `X ⟶ M` on `X ⟶ S`; I don't know whether the work of @adamtopaz [on Lawvere theory](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24T339nz9ik) is relevant here.\r\n\r\nThe next goal would be the anti-equivalence between the category of affine group schemes to [HopfAlgebraCat](https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/Mathlib/Algebra/Category/HopfAlgebraCat/Basic.html#HopfAlgebraCat), as Hopf algebras can be seen as cogroup objects (w.r.t. coproduct, i.e. tensor product) in the category of R-algebras. (On the other hand R-algebras can be seen as monoid objects in R-Mod w.r.t. tensor product, which is super confusing ...)",
