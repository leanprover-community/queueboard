This PR weakens the assumption for the definition of `QuadraticMap.associatedHom` and `QuadraticMap.associated` from `[Invertible (2 : R)]` to `[Invertible (2 : Module.End R N)]`, where `N` is the target module of he quadratic map.\r\n\r\nSee [this discussion](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/217875-Is-there-code-for-X.3F/topic/Quadratic.20forms.20with.20values.20in.20a.20larger.20ring/near/450582700) on Zulip.\r\n\r\nOn the way, we fix some mistakes in docstrings.\r\n\r\n---\r\n<!-- The text above the `---` will become the commit message when your\r\nPR is merged.
