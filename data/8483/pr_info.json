Comments therein addressed.\r\n\r\nFor any continuously differentiable vector field (section of tangent bundle) on a manifold `M` and any chosen interior point `x₀ : M`, there exists an integral curve `γ : ℝ → M` such that `γ t₀ = x₀` for any real number `t₀` and the tangent vector of `γ` at `t` coincides with the vector field at `γ t` for all `t` within an open interval around `t₀`.\r\n\r\nAs a corollary, such an integral curve exists for any starting point `x₀` if `M` is a manifold without boundary.\r\n\r\nWe define three `Prop`s:\r\n1. `IsIntegralCurveOn γ v s` means `γ t` is tangent to `v (γ t)` for all `t` within `s : Set ℝ`.\r\n2. `IsIntegralCurveAt γ v t₀` means `γ` is a local integral curve to `v`. That is, `γ t` is tangent to `v (γ t)` for all `t` within some open interval of `t₀`.\r\n3. `IsIntegralCurve γ v` means `γ` is a global integral curve to `v`. That is, `γ t` is tangent to `v (γ t)` for all `t : ℝ`.\r\n\r\nLemmas about rescaling and translation of integral curves are proven:\r\n* If `γ` solves `v` at `t₀`, then `γ (t + dt)` is tangent to `v` at `t₀ - dt`.\r\n* If `γ` solves `v` at `t₀`, then `γ (a * t)` is tangent to `a • v` at `t₀ / a` for any non-zero `a`.\r\n* The constant function at `x₀` solves any `v` with `v x₀ = 0`.\r\n\r\nWe also shuffle the position of `∃ ε > (0 : ℝ)` in `PicardLindelof` to one that makes more sense, since `f t₀ = x₀` does not depend on `ε` yet.\r\n\r\n---\r\n<!-- The text above the `---` will become the commit message when your\r\nPR is merged.

(x y : M) := (tangentBundleCore I M).coordChange (achart H x) (achart H y)\r\n```\r\ntogether with a bunch of helper lemmas about `tangentCoordChange I x x` and compositions of `tangentCoordChange`. These are just elevated versions of `VectorBundleCore` fields, except the hypotheses like `∀ x ∈ s.baseSet i,` are now `∀ x ∈ (extChartAt I y).source`.\r\n\r\nPerhaps there is a better approach.

              "body": "The more I think about this, the more I believe the terminology in this PR is a bit unfortunate: this PR shows the *local* existence of integral curves - not global existence. Informally speaking (which matches e.g. Lee's textbook), an integral curve is a continuously differentiable curve $\\gamma\\colon (-\\epsilon,\\epsilon)\\to M$ with $\\gamma'(t)=v_{\\gamma(t)}$ for all $t$. This formalisation considers curves defined on $\\mathbb{R}$, using the familiar junk value pattern --- that's fair. But this has the potential to confuse non-experts in Lean (who might believe you just proved *global* existence).\r\n\r\nAt least, I'd like the documention to be crystal clear that integral curves are defined on $\\mathbb{R}$, but are only tangent on some interval. Many places mention this already; I'd suggest a few more\r\n- the docstring of `IsIntegralCurveAt` should also mention this\r\n- how about adding a section \"Implementation notes\" in the main docstring and mentioning this junk value pattern?\r\n- rename the main theorem to something with local existence?\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the latest when formalising global existence, I expect you'd need a more flexible definition, to encode the time of existence explicitly --- for instance, a predicate \"IsIntegralCurveOn\" taking a curve, vector field and time interval. I'm fine with this being added later. If you want to add it today, you can it for `isIntegralCurveAt_const` already. \r\n\r\nThat said: that's about the only thing left I have to comment. Thank you for all the hard work!",

              "body": "I believe the tangent bundle API could be much more convenient than it is now. To do coordinate changes, you currently have to go down to the level of `VectorBundleCore` and specify chart choices `achart H x`. Since we'd like to work a lot more with `extChartAt I x`, I suggest a shorthand like:\r\n```\r\ndef tangentCoordChange (I) {M} ... (x y : M) := (tangentBundleCore I M).coordChange (achart H x) (achart H y)\r\n```\r\ntogether with a bunch of helper lemmas about `tangentCoordChange I x x` and compositions of `tangentCoordChange`. These are just elevated versions of `VectorBundleCore` fields, except the hypotheses like `∀ x ∈ s.baseSet i,` are now `∀ x ∈ (extChartAt I y).source`.\r\n\r\nPerhaps there is a better approach. Just writing this idea down so I don't forget.",

              "body": "The more I think about this, the more I believe the terminology in this PR is a bit unfortunate: this PR shows the *local* existence of integral curves - not global existence. Informally speaking (which matches e.g. Lee's textbook), an integral curve is a continuously differentiable curve $\\gamma\\colon (-\\epsilon,\\epsilon)\\to M$ with $\\gamma'(t)=v_{\\gamma(t)}$ for all $t$. This formalisation considers curves defined on $\\mathbb{R}$, using the familiar junk value pattern --- that's fair. But this has the potential to confuse non-experts in Lean (who might believe you just proved *global* existence).\r\n\r\nAt least, I'd like the documention to be crystal clear that integral curves are defined on $\\mathbb{R}$, but are only tangent on some interval. Many places mention this already; I'd suggest a few more\r\n- the docstring of `IsIntegralCurveAt` should also mention this\r\n- how about adding a section \"Implementation notes\" in the main docstring and mentioning this junk value pattern?\r\n- rename the main theorem to something with local existence?\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the latest when formalising global existence, I expect you'd need a more flexible definition, to encode the time of existence explicitly --- for instance, a predicate \"IsIntegralCurveOn\" taking a curve, vector field and time interval. I'm fine with this being added later. If you want to add it today, you can it for `isIntegralCurveAt_const` already. \r\n\r\nThat said: that's about the only thing left I have to comment.
