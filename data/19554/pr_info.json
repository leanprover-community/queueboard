So even a local notation would be very convenient.\n\nNiels on the Xena Discord suggested `≗` as a notation (read as order equivalent). I like this: it's both a senseless symbol with no risk of ambiguity, but the notation also makes sense. What do you think about making this into a scoped notation? ",
