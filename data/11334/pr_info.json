I'd advocate for going via `AddCircle`: we should prove that for any `0 < T`, the natural quotient map from `ℝ` to `AddCircle T` is a partial equiv resp. local homemorph, and then show that `AddCircle.toCircle` is a homeomorphism `AddCircle T → circle`.",

In the meantime, it seems fine to add these constructions manually?\r\n\r\nMy point is that in the current state of the library it would still probably be easier to go via AddCircle, since there is already a lot of API present for equivalences between AddCircle and various kinds of intervals. Moreover, this would work over arbitrary linearly ordered rings, rather than being specific to the reals.\r\n\r\n> If you do want the corresponding constructions for `AddCircle`, it might currently be easiest to construct them from `circle` rather than the other way around since currently `AddCircle.toCircle` imports `Analysis/SpecialFunctions/Complex/Circle` (although that could be changed).\r\n\r\nWell, AddCircle.toCircle is the map between both kinds of circle, so of course the file defining it needs to import the files defining both. But most of the AddCircle API is defined elsewhere.\r\n\r\n",

Moreover, this would work over arbitrary linearly ordered rings, rather than being specific to the reals.\r\n\r\n> If you do want the corresponding constructions for `AddCircle`, it might currently be easiest to construct them from `circle` rather than the other way around since currently `AddCircle.toCircle` imports `Analysis/SpecialFunctions/Complex/Circle` (although that could be changed).\r\n\r\nWell, AddCircle.toCircle is the map between both kinds of circle, so of course the file defining it needs to import the files defining both. But most of the AddCircle API is defined elsewhere.\r\n\r\n",
