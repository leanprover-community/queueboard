I am still new to formalization, so I am open any and all suggestions! In particular, the proofs here are a bit long compared to most proofs I see in the library, and I'm not sure if it's couth to use the `@[simp]` attribute for some equalities here.\r\n\r\nRemark: As I understand, the type of simplicial sets `SSet.{v}` also has an instance of `EnrichedCategory SSet.{v}` constructed in `AlgebraicTopology/SimplicialCategory/SimplicialObject`. This enrichment comes from viewing `SSet.{v}` as a category of simplicial objects, rather than as a closed monoidal category. I'm still a beginner, but could this cause any issues if a file imports both instances?\r\n\r\n[![Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io/from-referrer/)\r\n",
