              "body": "A couple of broader suggestions:\r\n1. I would suggest that `DyckPath` be renamed to `DyckOnePath` or something similar. Dyck languages can combine multiple kinds of brackets and you get `Dyck 1` or `Dyck 2` languages etc. In fact a `Nat` parameter could be attached to `Step` and `DyckPath` to signify the type of bracket. EDIT: Dyck word is more canonical terminology than Dyck path, at least in theoretical CS, so +1 to @trivial1711 's comment.\r\n2. Some notation for constructing Dyck paths might be helpful, even if they have to be quoted like `[Dyck1| UDUD]`\r\n3. If possible, the Dyck monoid instance could be added. This leads to nice theorems like Chomsky-Schutzenberger.",

When I was cleaning up this PR after merging master just after #15864 landed, I needed to split `insidePart_nest_add` and `outsidePart_nest_add` into two more elementary simp lemmas each to prove `DyckWord.le_add_self`, so I did that. Then I realised that I no longer needed to explicitly state `insidePart_nest_add`/`outsidePart_nest_add` in the only place where _they_ were used, in the proof of `treeEquiv_right_inv`, because the four simp lemmas replacing them are enough for `simp` to close the goal. So I could dispense with `insidePart_nest_add`, `outsidePart_nest_add` – and transitively `firstReturn_nest_add`.\r\n\r\n`p` has been made explicit in `denest_nest`/`nest_denest`.",

Dyck languages can combine multiple kinds of brackets and you get `Dyck 1` or `Dyck 2` languages etc. In fact a `Nat` parameter could be attached to `Step` and `DyckPath` to signify the type of bracket. EDIT: Dyck word is more canonical terminology than Dyck path, at least in theoretical CS, so +1 to @trivial1711 's comment.\r\n2. Some notation for constructing Dyck paths might be helpful, even if they have to be quoted like `[Dyck1| UDUD]`\r\n3. If possible, the Dyck monoid instance could be added. This leads to nice theorems like Chomsky-Schutzenberger.",
