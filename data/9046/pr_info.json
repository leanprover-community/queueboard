        "body": "Generalize the conditions of the tower law [FiniteDimensional.finrank_mul_finrank'](https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/Mathlib/FieldTheory/Tower.html#FiniteDimensional.finrank_mul_finrank') in FieldTheory/Tower from `[CommRing F] [Algebra F K]` to `[Ring F] [Module F K]`, and remove the `[Module.Finite F K]` and `[Module.Finite K A]` conditions.\r\n\r\nThe generalized version applies to situations when we have a tower C/B/A where the A-module structure on C is induced from the B-module structure via a RingHom from A to B, and the A-module structure on B is induced by the same RingHom. In particular, it applies when the A-module structure on B and the B-module structure on C come from two RingHoms, and the A-module structure on C comes from the composition of them, regardless of whether A and B are commutative or not.\r\n\r\nAs prerequisites, I also generalized lemmas originally introduced by @kckennylau in [mathlib3#3355](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/3355/files) to prove the tower law. They were split into three PRs:\r\n\r\n+ LinearAlgebra/Span #9380: add `span_eq_closure` and `closure_induction` which say that `Submodule.span R s` is generated by `R • s` as an AddSubmonoid. I feel that the existing `span_induction` should be replaced by `closure_induction` as the latter is stronger, and allow us to remove the commutativity condition in `span_smul_of_span_eq_top` in Algebra/Tower.\r\n\r\n+ Algebra/Tower #9382: switching from CommSemiring/Algebra to Semiring/Module here requires proving the curious lemma `IsScalarTower.isLinearMap` which states that for a tower of modules A/S/R, any S-linear map from S to A is also R-linear. If the map is injective, we can deduce that S/S/R also form a tower. (By `ringHomEquivModuleIsScalarTower` in #9381, there is therefore a canonical RingHom from R to S.)\r\n\r\n+ Lemmas for free modules over rings including `finrank_mul_finrank'` are moved from FieldTheory/Tower to LinearAlgebra/Dimension/Free\r\n\r\n[Zulip](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/Puzzle.3A.20noncommutative.20RingHom.20as.20typeclasses/near/407347711)\r\n\r\n---\r\n<!-- The text above the `---` will become the commit message when your\r\nPR is merged.

I think it's a pretty well-known bug that Lean has trouble inferring weaker instances from stronger ones, e.g. Algebra to Module to SMul.
