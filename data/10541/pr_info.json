This was inspired by how the `Polynomial` file currently deals with a similar separation. These are the main addition to this update.",

While this is inevitable for the moment, I don't believe that such lines have to be written by hand. Is there a possibility to define a new type in this way and automagically transfer some lemmas to the new type? (Maybe that boring part could be in `Init`.)",

The issues raised mostly stem from the fact that the separation is based on the one done in `Polynomial`, which duplicates theorems from `Finsupp`. Branching out from this would mean that we would no longer have the same theorems as in `Finsupp` which is a little bit unintuitive. With all of this in mind, I am no Mathlib expert and I am happy to be pointed to the correct direction (Leave things as they are or diverge). Here is a summary of the remaining issues:\r\n- The file is [too long](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/actions/runs/10075130070/job/27852708877) : I could split the file into two or more files by collecting the relevant sections together; but I am not an expert in this matter.\r\n- `IsSMulRegular` ([1](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/10541#discussion_r1646695226), [2](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/10541#discussion_r1689495429)): This follows what has been done in `Finsupp`and `Polynomial`. I am happy to add the more general theorems suggested if we are ok with divergence.\r\n- [`Module.Free`](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/10541#discussion_r1689491543) : This can be added and should take around 10-15 lines but we might want to split the file first.\r\n- `mul_apply_antidiagonal` : I have suggested a [fix](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/10541#discussion_r1679480901).\r\n- `smul` is not irreducible ([1](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/10541#discussion_r1680458770), [2](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/10541#discussion_r1684695183)) : As discussed this was to follow the style from `Polynomial`, I am happy to change it if we want to diverge from `Polynomial`.\r\n- Automation ([1](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/10541#issuecomment-2179484812), [2](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/10541#discussion_r1689479889), [3](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/10541#discussion_r1689496129)): I think these are out of scope for this PR but indeed should be noted somewhere if such separation are to happen often.\r\n- Unresolved conversations ([1](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/10541#discussion_r1680463959), [2](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/10541#discussion_r1689512167), [3](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/10541#discussion_r1689516061)): For the rest of the unresolved conversation, I have left them open in case my answer is not satisfactory.

This was inspired by how the `Polynomial` file currently deals with a similar separation. These are the main addition to this update.",

While this is inevitable for the moment, I don't believe that such lines have to be written by hand. Is there a possibility to define a new type in this way and automagically transfer some lemmas to the new type? (Maybe that boring part could be in `Init`.)",

              "body": "There are many open conversations above that I am not sure how to resolve. The issues raised mostly stem from the fact that the separation is based on the one done in `Polynomial`, which duplicates theorems from `Finsupp`. Branching out from this would mean that we would no longer have the same theorems as in `Finsupp` which is a little bit unintuitive. With all of this in mind, I am no Mathlib expert and I am happy to be pointed to the correct direction (Leave things as they are or diverge). Here is a summary of the remaining issues:\r\n- The file is [too long](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/actions/runs/10075130070/job/27852708877) : I could split the file into two or more files by collecting the relevant sections together; but I am not an expert in this matter.\r\n- `IsSMulRegular` ([1](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/10541#discussion_r1646695226), [2](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/10541#discussion_r1689495429)): This follows what has been done in `Finsupp`and `Polynomial`. I am happy to add the more general theorems suggested if we are ok with divergence.\r\n- [`Module.Free`](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/10541#discussion_r1689491543) : This can be added and should take around 10-15 lines but we might want to split the file first.\r\n- `mul_apply_antidiagonal` : I have suggested a [fix](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/10541#discussion_r1679480901).\r\n- `smul` is not irreducible ([1](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/10541#discussion_r1680458770), [2](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/10541#discussion_r1684695183)) : As discussed this was to follow the style from `Polynomial`, I am happy to change it if we want to diverge from `Polynomial`.\r\n- Automation ([1](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/10541#issuecomment-2179484812), [2](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/10541#discussion_r1689479889), [3](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/10541#discussion_r1689496129)): I think these are out of scope for this PR but indeed should be noted somewhere if such separation are to happen often.\r\n- Unresolved conversations ([1](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/10541#discussion_r1680463959), [2](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/10541#discussion_r1689512167), [3](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/10541#discussion_r1689516061)): For the rest of the unresolved conversation, I have left them open in case my answer is not satisfactory.

And then `Polynomial` and `MvPolynomial` and `MonoidAlgebra` would align on it.
