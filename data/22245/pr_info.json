        "body": "This introduces a file `Classifier.lean` defining the notion `Classifier C` of subobject classifier in any category `C` with a terminal object, following Section I.3 of \"Sheaves in Geometry and Logic\" [MM92]. This is related to but independent from #21281, because our definition associates a characteristic map to every _subobject_ rather than every _monomorphism_. Adopting this \"extensional\" rather than \"intensional\" definition allows us to formalize the proof of Proposition 1 in [MM92, Section I.3] (`hasClassifier_isRepresentable_iff`), that `C` has a subobject classifier if and only if the subobjects presheaf `sub C` is representable.\r\n\r\n---\r\n<!-- The text above the `---` will become the commit message when your\r\nPR is merged.

You may contribute with the relation between the data/existence of a classifier in the sense of #21281, and the representability of the \"subobject\" functor, but you should certainly introduce a few auxiliary definitions/lemmas in order to provide a suitable API.\r\n\r\nCan you be more specific as to what parts are duplicated? I think most of this formalization exploits some definitions in `CategoryTheory.Subobject`, which is not the case in #21281.\r\n\r\nConcerning the relationship with the \"intensional\" classifier in the sense of #21281, I think going from intensional to extensional (my definition) should be quite easy, but not the other way around. I see two possible ways:\r\n\r\n1. To avoid confusion, I just remove my definitions of `IsClassifier`, `Classifier` and `HasClassifier`, and build the other definitions based on them directly from those of #21281;\r\n2. I keep both variants in separate namespaces (`CategoryTheory` for the intensional version, and `CategoryTheory.Subobject` for the extensional one), and add an API to build a `CategoryTheory.Subobject.Classifier` from a `CategoryTheory.Classifier`.\r\n\r\n(1) would ensure \"automatically\" that we use the same naming conventions, avoiding potential duplication and making for a shorter contribution. (2) could be useful in situations where one wants only the weaker notion of extensional subobject classifier. For instance, the bijection between monos and their characteristic map trivially gives a bijection between subobjects and their characteristic map, but this is not true in the other direction.\r\n\r\nI would argue in favor of (2) because it can be used to produce more general results requiring fewer assumptions. Unfortunately there does not seem to be anyway to directly share code with #21281 (e.g. with structure inheritance).\r\n",

Or is it the case that in Lean, every essentially surjective functor is split essentially surjective (see [the nLab](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/equivalence+of+categories#idea))?\r\n\r\nAnyway I am fine trying to follow route (1), but I am not sure about what statement you have in mind for `Classifier.representableBy`. If it is `HasClassifier C -> sub.representableBy Ω`, then this is just a direct corollary of my `hasClassifier_isRepresentable_iff` theorem. Should I still add it?",

You may contribute with the relation between the data/existence of a classifier in the sense of #21281, and the representability of the \"subobject\" functor, but you should certainly introduce a few auxiliary definitions/lemmas in order to provide a suitable API.\r\n\r\nCan you be more specific as to what parts are duplicated? I think most of this formalization exploits some definitions in `CategoryTheory.Subobject`, which is not the case in #21281.\r\n\r\nConcerning the relationship with the \"intensional\" classifier in the sense of #21281, I think going from intensional to extensional (my definition) should be quite easy, but not the other way around. I see two possible ways:\r\n\r\n1. To avoid confusion, I just remove my definitions of `IsClassifier`, `Classifier` and `HasClassifier`, and build the other definitions based on them directly from those of #21281;\r\n2. I keep both variants in separate namespaces (`CategoryTheory` for the intensional version, and `CategoryTheory.Subobject` for the extensional one), and add an API to build a `CategoryTheory.Subobject.Classifier` from a `CategoryTheory.Classifier`.\r\n\r\n(1) would ensure \"automatically\" that we use the same naming conventions, avoiding potential duplication and making for a shorter contribution. (2) could be useful in situations where one wants only the weaker notion of extensional subobject classifier. For instance, the bijection between monos and their characteristic map trivially gives a bijection between subobjects and their characteristic map, but this is not true in the other direction.\r\n\r\nI would argue in favor of (2) because it can be used to produce more general results requiring fewer assumptions. Unfortunately there does not seem to be anyway to directly share code with #21281 (e.g. with structure inheritance).\r\n",
