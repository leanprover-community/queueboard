I think this is a really great contribution to mathlib, and it comes at exactly the right time for me (+ for my project student Giulio, who wants to use this in a proof of Mahler's theorem). Keep up the good work!\r\n\r\nThanks very much for reviewing my work! I have to take some time to understand your suggestions. I tried to implement them too quickly, and I don't think I did this properly. ",
