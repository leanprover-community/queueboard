(I'm a little uncomfortable with `eq1` etc and `onag` in names, but perhaps just making these private is good enough, or even the fact that they are already well namespaced.)",

My interest of games in Lean was motivated foremost by the fact their API is very similar to that of ordinals (in fact, ordinals are just games when you remove right options!), which is a topic I'm much more familiar in. That said, I really don't want this PR to rot over the following months. I'll try reading up to surreal division throughout the next week or so, and if no one else has stepped in by then, I'll give a proper PR review.",

That said, I really don't want this PR to rot over the following months. I'll try reading up to surreal division throughout the next week or so, and if no one else has stepped in by then, I'll give a proper PR review.",
