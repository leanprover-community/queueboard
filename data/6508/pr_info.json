Note that I am totally open-minded about whether this PR gets merged: it was just a Friday night idea. I totally agree that there is a far stronger case for BSD to be included.\r\n\r\nOliver: x^n+y^n=z^n is a smooth projective curve and it makes sense to ask about its solutions over many fields, as of course you know. If you change the field then you change the question, and for some fields the answer is simple and for others it's complicated. The n=3 case is interesting because it is the point where the Euler characteristic changes from positive to negative; this topological invariant controls the arithmetic of the curve, but when the characteristic is 0 whether you get finitely many or infinitely many solutions depends also on the arithmetic of the field; for example there are many number fields where x^3+y^3=z^3 has infinitely many projective points. For function fields I should think that there is certainly potential for a PR.",

Note that I am totally open-minded about whether this PR gets merged: it was just a Friday night idea. I totally agree that there is a far stronger case for BSD to be included.\r\n\r\nOliver: x^n+y^n=z^n is a smooth projective curve and it makes sense to ask about its solutions over many fields, as of course you know. If you change the field then you change the question, and for some fields the answer is simple and for others it's complicated. The n=3 case is interesting because it is the point where the Euler characteristic changes from positive to negative; this topological invariant controls the arithmetic of the curve, but when the characteristic is 0 whether you get finitely many or infinitely many solutions depends also on the arithmetic of the field; for example there are many number fields where x^3+y^3=z^3 has infinitely many projective points. For function fields I should think that there is certainly potential for a PR.",
