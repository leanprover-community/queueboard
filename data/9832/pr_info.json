(I can remove them manually if needed.)\r\n- ~1000 removed `docBlame` warnings: these docstrings are not added; it seems the lint doesn't warn about missing docs on class or structure fields any more.\r\n- 19 new `impossibleInstance` warnings (not checked)\r\n- 460 new `simpComm` warnings (no idea what this is)\r\n- ~5500 new `simpNF` warnings\r\nI spot-checked these in `Filter.Germ`; there's no `simpNF` next to these lemmas. I don't get why they show up.\r\n- 1212 new `simpVarHead` warnings; not sure why these are emitted\r\n- 2 new `structureInType` warnings, 4 new `synTaut` warnings, 2 new `unusedArguments` warnings\r\n",

I don't understand how this file could grow if that were the case.\r\n\r\n`@[nolint _]` and `nolints.json` are not orthogonal: a lint is suppressed if either mechanism is used. The meaning is slightly different: `nolints.json` is for grandfathered / unintentional lint suppression, while `@[nolint]` is for deliberate lint suppression. (That is, it is reasonable to have a goal of \"drive `nolints.json` to empty\", but not \"remove all `@[nolint]`\".)",

The 6000 checkType warnings are saying that the statement of the theorem doesn't typecheck, this seems *very* suspicious. Also my understanding is also like Eric's, that this file can never grow from `--update` because any nolint which was not in the original file and is being added is a lint warning that would be generated without `--update`, and we run that in CI. So either there is an issue in the CI script or in the way `runLinter --update` was run (e.g. if the oleans were out of date).",

The meaning is slightly different: `nolints.json` is for grandfathered / unintentional lint suppression, while `@[nolint]` is for deliberate lint suppression. (That is, it is reasonable to have a goal of \"drive `nolints.json` to empty\", but not \"remove all `@[nolint]`\".)",

The 6000 checkType warnings are saying that the statement of the theorem doesn't typecheck, this seems *very* suspicious. Also my understanding is also like Eric's, that this file can never grow from `--update` because any nolint which was not in the original file and is being added is a lint warning that would be generated without `--update`, and we run that in CI. So either there is an issue in the CI script or in the way `runLinter --update` was run (e.g. if the oleans were out of date).",
