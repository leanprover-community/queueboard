This prevents you from considering the cyclotomic character relative to a fixed \"base\" field in the following sense: if $F/K$ is an extension of number fields (say...) both embedded in $L=F(\\zeta_{p^{\\infty}})$ then you only get an \"absolute\" cyclotomic character rather than one, $\\chi_K$, relative to $K$ and one, $\\chi_F$ relative to $F$ whose image will possibly be a proper subgroup of the image of $\\chi_K$. Now, it seems to me that it is useful to keep track of this information and with your construction one would constantly need to change $\\chi_0$ to a suitable power to get a new character whose image is the one you are interested in.\r\n\r\nI wonder if the construction should not rather be parametrised over an algebra $L/K$ and the domain should be the $K$-algebra isomorphisms of $L$. This would make it more compatible with the definition of the absolute Galois group we have now in Mathlib.",

This prevents you from considering the cyclotomic character relative to a fixed \"base\" field in the following sense: if $F/K$ is an extension of number fields (say...) both embedded in $L=F(\\zeta_{p^{\\infty}})$ then you only get an \"absolute\" cyclotomic character rather than one, $\\chi_K$, relative to $K$ and one, $\\chi_F$ relative to $F$ whose image will possibly be a proper subgroup of the image of $\\chi_K$. Now, it seems to me that it is useful to keep track of this information and with your construction one would constantly need to change $\\chi_0$ to a suitable power to get a new character whose image is the one you are interested in.\r\n\r\nI wonder if the construction should not rather be parametrised over an algebra $L/K$ and the domain should be the $K$-algebra isomorphisms of $L$. This would make it more compatible with the definition of the absolute Galois group we have now in Mathlib.",

I think that this gadget is the one that really shows off more often e.g. in interpolating special values of $L$-functions beyond Dirichlet ones.

On a one hand, this one can be useful to construct the other one and on the other hand one might want to simply use the map leaving from $\\mathrm{Aut}(L)$ as a field. Probably, though, I would call my version the cyclotomic \"character\" and this one something else (cyclotomic hom?).",
