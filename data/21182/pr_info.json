Recursive calls will likely still not work, and use the declaration that has just been added to the environment, as will declarations that contain `declId`s before the actual `declId` of the declaration, but... nobody's perfect!",

Recursive calls will likely still not work, and use the declaration that has just been added to the environment, as will declarations that contain `declId`s before the actual `declId` of the declaration, but... nobody's perfect!",
