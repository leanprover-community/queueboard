Ideally with sample code.\r\nAlso you write that it does not lead to uglifications past the basic API, but to be fair I don't think there is really anything in Mathlib using it beyond basic API, so that's not telling much.\r\n\r\nFor `Measurable` (and its variants) as well as `Integrable` we introduced the `Measurable[m]` notation to deal with a similar issue, although here you would ideally have to find a way to do that while not losing dot notation. I am not sure that's the best solution here, but it's an option.",

Ideally with sample code.\r\nAlso you write that it does not lead to uglifications past the basic API, but to be fair I don't think there is really anything in Mathlib using it beyond basic API, so that's not telling much.\r\n\r\nFor `Measurable` (and its variants) as well as `Integrable` we introduced the `Measurable[m]` notation to deal with a similar issue, although here you would ideally have to find a way to do that while not losing dot notation. I am not sure that's the best solution here, but it's an option.",
