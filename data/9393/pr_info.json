To reduce damage, we can `import` this file very early as soon as both `Positivity.Core` and `GCongr.Core` are imported. OTOH, we already have a similar footgun with `Positivity.Core` vs `Positivity`, so maybe the right way to solve the issue is to add documentation to `gcongr` and `positivity` (\"if the tactic fails, first make sure that your file imports ...\").",

I opened a [Zulip thread](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/287929-mathlib4/topic/Lemmas.20vs.E2.80.8C.20Defs/near/416948726).\r\n2. what are the `tt - ff` comments in the `GCongr` file, which are being deleted in this PR. Are we losing information of some sort?\r\n3. It would be nice to have documented somewhere an example of a \"bad\" `gcongr` lemmma (i.e., one that a user might at first glance think would be a good lemma, but actually isn't for some reason).

To reduce damage, we can `import` this file very early as soon as both `Positivity.Core` and `GCongr.Core` are imported. OTOH, we already have a similar footgun with `Positivity.Core` vs `Positivity`, so maybe the right way to solve the issue is to add documentation to `gcongr` and `positivity` (\"if the tactic fails, first make sure that your file imports ...\").",
