If you object to this way of doing it, we can always go back, of course.\r\n\r\nThe whitelist is now only used to ignore characters. Special cases such as variant selectors and emojis are checked further and then allowed (if used correctly) **despite not being in the whitelist**. This way we have only one lookup in the whitelist for each whitelisted character, which should be faster. Speed is probably not relevant (my version, on my laptop takes 9sec, yours 14sec, not counting compile time)  but I hope this code is clearer.\r\n\r\nThere may be an issue with the usage of the `next` and `prev` functions. They operate on UTF8 bytes and give unspecified results if given an invalid position (which I'm not sure can happen with the current code but I think yes?!).\r\n\r\nI'm also not sure about which characters exactly should have which selectors if any. Some arrows in Mathlib have text selectors, for example. For several characters in the emoji-list, the selectors don't seem to be doing anything (though this depends on the font you use). Can we check this once more?\r\n\r\nedit: I guess I was dumb and actually the `next` / `prev` is not an issue because the positions given by `findAll` will be valid. I fixed the case where it's going beyond the `endPos`.",

I think splitting the removal of non-breaking spaces into a separate PR (do you know git cherry-pick?) makes sense, and would be happy to nominate it for the maintainers to look. Reading the zulip discussion, changing the spaces does not appear controversial to me.\r\n\r\nUpdate: for me, splitting the space changes is positive anyway, as it's a large enough change (200 lines), completely mechanic and very different from the rest of this PR. That would be true regardless of whether the change is controversial.",

If you object to this way of doing it, we can always go back, of course.\r\n\r\nThe whitelist is now only used to ignore characters. Special cases such as variant selectors and emojis are checked further and then allowed (if used correctly) **despite not being in the whitelist**. This way we have only one lookup in the whitelist for each whitelisted character, which should be faster. Speed is probably not relevant (my version, on my laptop takes 9sec, yours 14sec, not counting compile time)  but I hope this code is clearer.\r\n\r\nThere may be an issue with the usage of the `next` and `prev` functions. They operate on UTF8 bytes and give unspecified results if given an invalid position (which I'm not sure can happen with the current code but I think yes?!).\r\n\r\nI'm also not sure about which characters exactly should have which selectors if any. Some arrows in Mathlib have text selectors, for example. For several characters in the emoji-list, the selectors don't seem to be doing anything (though this depends on the font you use). Can we check this once more?\r\n\r\nedit: I guess I was dumb and actually the `next` / `prev` is not an issue because the positions given by `findAll` will be valid. I fixed the case where it's going beyond the `endPos`.",
