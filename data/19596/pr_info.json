My feeling is that we should avoid having two different approaches to valuations, becuse this would make the library harder to maintain. On the long run, I would even suggest that we get rid of the additive p-adic valuation, but that's another point. At any rate, are you sure that `@to_additive` really plays well with valuations, expecially given that they are valued in `StuffWithZero`?",

Is there a specific reason why you want to work with (and improve) `addVal`? The reason why we ended up chosing one of the two was to avoid a lot of code duplication, when possible, and there is no advantage of using additive rather than multiplicative valuations, beyond a psychological one, I believe. But perhaps you have something else in sight.\r\n> \r\n> This is mostly psychological, but it's also to match [padicValRat](https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/Mathlib/NumberTheory/Padics/PadicVal/Basic.html#padicValRat) and the general convention for p-adic valuation, and it's annoying to use `Multiplicative.ofAdd` everywhere. Don't `@[to_additive]` and `AddValuation.ofValuation`/`AddValuation.toValuation` mostly resolve the problem of duplication?\r\n\r\nI understand. My feeling is that we should avoid having two different approaches to valuations, becuse this would make the library harder to maintain. On the long run, I would even suggest that we get rid of the additive p-adic valuation, but that's another point. At any rate, are you sure that `@to_additive` really plays well with valuations, expecially given that they are valued in `StuffWithZero`?",
