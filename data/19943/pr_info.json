(Note it's not just reviewing the material initially, but being confident we have expertise if this need repairing or refactoring in a few years.) No definitive answer was reached, and Yael's review may push things in a different direction. But I thought it good to be up front about the discussion.",

Anyways, it would be nice to at least know that there is a prospect of this being merged before I pour more effort into it.",

Instead of accepting everything blindly in the `mathlib4` repo, we are now considering the possibility of having several mathlib repos, a central one (this one) along with one for each \"mathematical dead end\", namely one for each subdomain whose results are unlikely to ever be used in another domain. Eg here we could have the repo `mathlib-formal-language`. See https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/channel/287929-mathlib4/topic/Repository.20for.20combinatorial.20games for more information.\r\n\r\nLong story short, I think it's worth reviewing anyway.",

(Note it's not just reviewing the material initially, but being confident we have expertise if this need repairing or refactoring in a few years.) No definitive answer was reached, and Yael's review may push things in a different direction. But I thought it good to be up front about the discussion.",

Anyways, it would be nice to at least know that there is a prospect of this being merged before I pour more effort into it.",

              "body": "Being merged or not being merged I think is not greatly relevant. We are at a pivotal period of mathlib where we're hitting the limits of the monorepo model. Instead of accepting everything blindly in the `mathlib4` repo, we are now considering the possibility of having several mathlib repos, a central one (this one) along with one for each \"mathematical dead end\", namely one for each subdomain whose results are unlikely to ever be used in another domain. Eg here we could have the repo `mathlib-formal-language`. See https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/channel/287929-mathlib4/topic/Repository.20for.20combinatorial.20games for more information.\r\n\r\nLong story short, I think it's worth reviewing anyway.",
