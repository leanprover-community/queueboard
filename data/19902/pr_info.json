        "body": "Given an integral domain `R` and its fraction field `K`, we define an `R`-lattice in a `K`-vector space `V` to be a finitely generated `R`-submodule of `V` that generates `V` over `K`. If `R` is a PID a lattice is always a free `R`-module of rank `Module.rank K V`.\r\n\r\nThe unit group of `R` naturally acts on the type of `R`-lattices in `V`. If `V = Fin 2 → K` and `R` is a discrete valuation ring, the quotient by this action are the vertices of the Bruhat-Tits tree of `GL (Fin 2) K`.\r\n\r\nIn this PR the predicate `IsLattice` on a submodule `M` is defined and some basic stability properties are shown.\r\n\r\nFrom \"Formalizing the Bruhat-Tits tree\"\r\n\r\nCo-authored by: Judith Ludwig <ludwig@mathi.uni-heidelberg.de>\r\n\r\n---\r\n<!-- The text above the `---` will become the commit message when your\r\nPR is merged.

Our current project is on formalizing the Bruhat-Tits tree, and for that we work in the setting of a DVR, so our setting is local, not global. (Vertices in the Bruhat-Tits tree are defined as homothety classes of lattices.) This motivates this pull request.",

Thanks!\r\n\r\nThere are indeed surely connection that should be made with `IsZLattice` and eventually `IsZLattice` should just become a special case of `IsLattice`.  One main difference I can see is though that, for `IsZLattice`, we ask the module to be discrete whereas for `IsLattice`, we ask for it to be finitely generated. If I understand, this definition of lattice has been made because it is the one that appears in  Bruhat-Tits tree, but I am not sure that is the one we want in Mathlib. There was some time ago a discussion on Zulip about what the right generalization of `IsZLattice` should be, it would be great to get the opinion of the people involved in the discussion. ",

Our current project is on formalizing the Bruhat-Tits tree, and for that we work in the setting of a DVR, so our setting is local, not global. (Vertices in the Bruhat-Tits tree are defined as homothety classes of lattices.) This motivates this pull request.",

Thanks!\r\n\r\nThere are indeed surely connection that should be made with `IsZLattice` and eventually `IsZLattice` should just become a special case of `IsLattice`.  One main difference I can see is though that, for `IsZLattice`, we ask the module to be discrete whereas for `IsLattice`, we ask for it to be finitely generated. If I understand, this definition of lattice has been made because it is the one that appears in  Bruhat-Tits tree, but I am not sure that is the one we want in Mathlib. There was some time ago a discussion on Zulip about what the right generalization of `IsZLattice` should be, it would be great to get the opinion of the people involved in the discussion. ",
