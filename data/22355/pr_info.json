But I think the reason why we want these lemmas is that sometimes, we still have to work with the concrete elements, and it's good to have a criterion about exactly which elements are mapped to the same one. For more on how these lemma have been used, you can refer to #22279, in that PR, we have to explicitly deal with when the elements are mapped to the same.",

But I think the reason why we want these lemmas is that sometimes, we still have to work with the concrete elements, and it's good to have a criterion about exactly which elements are mapped to the same one. For more on how these lemma have been used, you can refer to #22279, in that PR, we have to explicitly deal with when the elements are mapped to the same.",
