And second, there's no guarantee someone else couldn't come to this file later on and add or switch out these dependencies.\n\nThe archive is meant as a showcase of good proofs, which doesn't always overlap with a good mathematical presentation.

I took a first look at your PR.\r\nThere are a number of places where your code can be written more compactly (i.e., doing the same thing, but being shorter). Such is completely normal for a first pull request. I have left some comments to get you started.\r\n\r\nA number of comments occur several times: when addressing it once, please try to go over the file and fix all instances of it. If you're unsure, feel free to ask here (or on zulip)!",

You can consider this a quotient group of the circle group, but I don't think the subgroup you'd have to quotient by has such a simple description as \"the rationals\". So it's fine to keep the explicit setoid.\n\nYou can actually prove a stronger result: any choice function on R / Q gives you a non-measurable set. That being said, the only proof I know of this is that if you had such a measurable set, you could \"bunch up\" everything into [0, 1] and get a measurable Vitali set. Since this file isn't going to get used in any future developments, I think it's fine to just prove the version on [0, 1].",

Informally the two proofs look similar.  But I suspect you need to do more work to formalize the circle version.

First of all, you're not even making the formal guarantee that these are sufficient conditions for the theorem to hold (and if you did, you'd likely end up with a much uglier and unwieldy statement). And second, there's no guarantee someone else couldn't come to this file later on and add or switch out these dependencies.\n\nThe archive is meant as a showcase of good proofs, which doesn't always overlap with a good mathematical presentation. I really don't think we need to go over the basics of measure theory here.",
