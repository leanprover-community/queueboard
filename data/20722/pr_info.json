First of all, you're not even making the formal guarantee that these are sufficient conditions for the theorem to hold (and if you did, you'd likely end up with a much uglier and unwieldy statement). And second, there's no guarantee someone else couldn't come to this file later on and add or switch out these dependencies.\n\nThe archive is meant as a showcase of good proofs, which doesn't always overlap with a good mathematical presentation. I really don't think we need to go over the basics of measure theory here.",

I took a first look at your PR.\r\nThere are a number of places where your code can be written more compactly (i.e., doing the same thing, but being shorter). Such is completely normal for a first pull request. I have left some comments to get you started.\r\n\r\nA number of comments occur several times: when addressing it once, please try to go over the file and fix all instances of it.

First of all, you're not even making the formal guarantee that these are sufficient conditions for the theorem to hold (and if you did, you'd likely end up with a much uglier and unwieldy statement). And second, there's no guarantee someone else couldn't come to this file later on and add or switch out these dependencies.\n\nThe archive is meant as a showcase of good proofs, which doesn't always overlap with a good mathematical presentation. I really don't think we need to go over the basics of measure theory here.",
