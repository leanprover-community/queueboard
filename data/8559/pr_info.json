        "body": "For $R$-modules $M$ and $D$ where $D$ is injective, we can consider the dual module $M^\\star := \\mathrm{Hom}_R(M, D)$. \r\n$(\\cdot^\\star)$ can define a contravariant functor $R$-mod to $R$-mod by $L \\mapsto L^\\star$ where $L^\\star f = f \\circ L$ where $L \\in \\mathrm{Hom}_R(M, N)$ and $f \\in N^\\star$. This functor sends monomorphisms to epimorphisms.\r\n\r\nFor an abelian group $A$, it is useful to consider its character module in the unit rational circle. This construction appears in proof of enough-injectiveness of groups and it can be shown that a module is flat if and only if its character module is injective, [reference](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/canadian-mathematical-bulletin/article/module-is-flat-if-and-only-if-its-character-module-is-injective/8D9669F28AC4DE35A1D65EA864F9B5DE). Hence we use Baer to relate ideals. \r\n\r\nAlso refactored enough-injectiveness of abelian groups. The refactor is not a separated PR because construction of character module needs some result from `GroupCat/Injective.lean` file. \r\n\r\n---\r\n<!-- The text above the `---` will become the commit message when your\r\nPR is merged.

Could you please consider making this split?",

In this commit, the domain M is a (R,Z)-bimodule and the codomain `AddCircle (1 : ℚ)` is only a Z-module, and the R-action on `CharacterModule M` is on the domain (of course). As the PR currently stands, both the domain and the codomain are R-modules and there isn't a second ring, and you're using LinearMap.module to define the R-module structure on `CharacterModule R M D`, which acts on the codomain (but it's equivalent to acting on the domain, because you consider R-linear maps not Z-linear maps).\r\n\r\nAre you sure the current definition can still help you prove things about flatness? Do you have it in some branch? I'd be curious to see. My suspicion is that Matlis duality doesn't fit in the same framework as what you want to do.",

Looking at it now, it seems that this PR should be split up into three: one PR about the additional lemmas about (semi)linear maps; another PR for character modules and their API; a final PR about the use of character modules for the proof of enough injectives. Could you please consider making this split?",
