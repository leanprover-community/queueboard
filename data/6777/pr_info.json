I would have thought a string match would cover pretty much every case.\r\n\r\nA string match will also hit uses of the identifier that are part of applications, as well as uses of the identifier as an ident which is not an expression context. Some of these might be replaceable by the expression, but not all of them, and my worry is that we are mixing these together now and will have difficulty teasing them apart later.",
