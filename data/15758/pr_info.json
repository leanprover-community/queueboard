I was expecting that the proof could be improved but I didn't know how.\r\n\r\nYour proof clearly looks much cleaner, and I really appreciate that you're taking time to explain all of this to me.\r\n\r\nI've accepted all your suggestions (with extremely minor changes just to avoid lint-style and build errors). Also, I've replaced `exact Nat.le_of_ble_eq_true rfl` by `rfl`. (In hindsight, Lean's `exact?` made a correct but unnecessarily complicated suggestion here.)\r\n\r\nIf anything further is required on my side before this PR can be merged, just let me know!",

              "body": "Thank you, @ScottCarnahan, for the extremely quick reply! I was expecting that the proof could be improved but I didn't know how.\r\n\r\nYour proof clearly looks much cleaner, and I really appreciate that you're taking time to explain all of this to me.\r\n\r\nI've accepted all your suggestions (with extremely minor changes just to avoid lint-style and build errors). Also, I've replaced `exact Nat.le_of_ble_eq_true rfl` by `rfl`. (In hindsight, Lean's `exact?` made a correct but unnecessarily complicated suggestion here.)\r\n\r\nIf anything further is required on my side before this PR can be merged, just let me know!",
