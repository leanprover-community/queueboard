(I certainly don't understand that part, at the moment.)\r\n- this PR just does the \"minimal\" thing, in a nice way. Adding a new label requires editing the list of labels in the implementation, but that seems reasonable enough (and the implementation is not too hard to read). So, I think it's good enough in practice.",

(I certainly don't understand that part, at the moment.)\r\n- this PR just does the \"minimal\" thing, in a nice way. Adding a new label requires editing the list of labels in the implementation, but that seems reasonable enough (and the implementation is not too hard to read). So, I think it's good enough in practice.",
