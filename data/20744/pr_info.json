Luckily, things worked out really well after refactoring everything to `Set M`. I totally agree that we should add some lemmas to link it to `Module.rank`, but perhaps we could move that to a separate PR?\r\n\r\nI noticed that `Module.rank` is implemented to take value as a `Cardinal`, do you think we should define `Module.spanRank` to be a `Cardinal` as well? @riccardobrasca @erdOne @chrisflav \r\n\r\nEdit: Already refactored to Cardinal, so another round of review might be needed.\r\n\r\nEdit: The third suggestion is being implemented now, but may need to wait for a while.",

Luckily, things worked out really well after refactoring everything to `Set M`. I totally agree that we should add some lemmas to link it to `Module.rank`, but perhaps we could move that to a separate PR?\r\n\r\nI noticed that `Module.rank` is implemented to take value as a `Cardinal`, do you think we should define `Module.spanRank` to be a `Cardinal` as well? @riccardobrasca @erdOne @chrisflav \r\n\r\nEdit: Already refactored to Cardinal, so another round of review might be needed.\r\n\r\nEdit: The third suggestion is being implemented now, but may need to wait for a while.",

This can of course be solved by sufficient API so changing the def to modules could be fine as long as there are tailored lemmas for submodules. One thing you would definitely lose is dot notation but this is not that important IMO.",
