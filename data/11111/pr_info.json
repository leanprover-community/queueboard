Since I was at it anyway, I also did a few more things:\r\n* Move the L-series stuff out of the `ArithmeticFunction` namespace. Use `LSeries` as a namespace for some of the declarations instead.\r\n* Introduce `LSeries.term f s n`; this denotes the `n`th term in the L-series `LSeries f s`. This is defined to be zero for `n = 0`; otherwise it is the usual `f n / n ^ s`. Provide basic API for it.\r\n* Re-write `LSeries` etc. in terms of `LSeries.term`. Attempt to isolate the meat of the proofs in suitable API lemmas for `LSeries.term`. Add some API (like congruence lemmas).\r\n* Use `s` for the complex variable (in place of `z` or `w`; `s` and `s'` when two are required), following the notational convention in analytic number theory.\r\n* Golf some proofs.\r\n* Add some documentation (and modify existing docstrings to fit the changes).\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n<!-- The text above the `---` will become the commit message when your\r\nPR is merged. Please leave a blank newline before the `---`, otherwise\r\nGitHub will format the text above it as a title.\r\n\r\nTo indicate co-authors, include lines at the bottom of the commit message\r\n(that is, before the `---`) using the following format:\r\n\r\nCo-authored-by: Author Name <author@email.com>\r\n\r\nAny other comments you want to keep out of the PR commit should go\r\nbelow the `---`, and placed outside this HTML comment, or else they\r\nwill be invisible to reviewers.\r\n\r\nIf this PR depends on other PRs, please list them below this comment,\r\nusing the following format:\r\n- [ ] depends on: #abc [optional extra text]\r\n- [ ] depends on: #xyz [optional extra text]\r\n-->\r\n\r\n[![Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io/from-referrer/)\r\n",
