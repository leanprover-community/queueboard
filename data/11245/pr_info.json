              "body": "> I feel that the arguments here could be shortened substantially by using `Complex.hasSum_deriv_of_summable_norm` in place of `hasFDerivAt_tsum`. The point is that for a series `∑' n, f n x`, the latter result requires a locally-uniform summable bound on `deriv f`, but the former only requires a locally-uniform summable bound on `f` (which is automatic under your assumptions).\r\n\r\nI've changed it. It is not that much shorter, though (we need to combine [Complex.differentiableOn_tsum_of_summable_norm](https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/Mathlib/Analysis/Complex/LocallyUniformLimit.html#Complex.differentiableOn_tsum_of_summable_norm) and [Complex.hasSum_deriv_of_summable_norm](https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/Mathlib/Analysis/Complex/LocallyUniformLimit.html#Complex.hasSum_deriv_of_summable_norm), and we still need to use a closed  half-plane contained in the open half-plane and containing `s`).\r\n\r\nOne could perhaps use this to deduce summability results on `log * f` from this (thus saving a few lines earlier in the file), but I think it is worth having the explicit estimate in `LSeries.norm_term_logMul_le_of_re_lt_re` in any case.",

The point is that for a series `∑' n, f n x`, the latter result requires a locally-uniform summable bound on `deriv f`, but the former only requires a locally-uniform summable bound on `f` (which is automatic under your assumptions). \r\n\r\n(The downside of `Complex.differentiableOn_tsum_of_summable_norm` is that it only works for 1-variable functions, but this covers the intended applications here.)",

It is not that much shorter, though (we need to combine [Complex.differentiableOn_tsum_of_summable_norm](https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/Mathlib/Analysis/Complex/LocallyUniformLimit.html#Complex.differentiableOn_tsum_of_summable_norm) and [Complex.hasSum_deriv_of_summable_norm](https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/Mathlib/Analysis/Complex/LocallyUniformLimit.html#Complex.hasSum_deriv_of_summable_norm), and we still need to use a closed  half-plane contained in the open half-plane and containing `s`).\r\n\r\nOne could perhaps use this to deduce summability results on `log * f` from this (thus saving a few lines earlier in the file), but I think it is worth having the explicit estimate in `LSeries.norm_term_logMul_le_of_re_lt_re` in any case.",
