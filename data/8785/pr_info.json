Also, given an additive or multiplicative group `A` with an appropriate scalar action of a group `G`, we define low degree cocycle/coboundary conditions on $Fun(G, A), Fun(G^2, A),$ and then link that up with the existing cocycle/coboundary types for the representation associated to `A`. Using this, `RepresentationTheory.GroupCohomology.Hilbert90` gets clearer.\r\n\r\nLots of `DistribMulAction` and `MulDistribMulAction` stuff here but it seems like they can't be related by `to_additive` afaik.\r\n\r\n<!-- The text above the `---` will become the commit message when your\r\nPR is merged. Please leave a blank newline before the `---`, otherwise\r\nGitHub will format the text above it as a title.\r\n\r\nTo indicate co-authors, include lines at the bottom of the commit message\r\n(that is, before the `---`) using the following format:\r\n\r\nCo-authored-by: Author Name <author@email.com>\r\n\r\nAny other comments you want to keep out of the PR commit should go\r\nbelow the `---`, and placed outside this HTML comment, or else they\r\nwill be invisible to reviewers.\r\n\r\nIf this PR depends on other PRs, please list them below this comment,\r\nusing the following format:\r\n- [ ] depends on: #abc [optional extra text]\r\n- [ ] depends on: #xyz [optional extra text]\r\n-->\r\n\r\n[![Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io/from-referrer/)\r\n",
