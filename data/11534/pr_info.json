        "body": "Define the injective and projective cross norms on a `PiTensorProduct` of normed vector spaces `Eᵢ` over a nontrivially normed field `𝕜` (cf https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_tensor_product#Cross_norms_and_tensor_products_of_Banach_spaces).\r\n\r\nThe projective norm, defined in `Analysis/NormedSpace/PiTensorProduct/ProjectiveNorm.lean`, is the biggest norm on the `PiTensorProduct` satisfying  `‖⨂ₜ[𝕜] i, m i‖ ≤ Π i, ‖m i‖` for every `m` in `Π i, Eᵢ`. We are mainly interested in the injective norm in this PR, so we just give the definition of the projective norm and its basic properties. To help with the proofs, we introduce some lemmas in `LinearAlgebra/PiTensorProduct.lean` about the set of lifts in `FreeAddMonoid (R × Π i, s i)` of an element `x` of `⨂[R] i, s i`.\r\n\r\nThe injective norm, defined in `Analysis/NormedSpace/PiTensorProduct/InjectiveSeminorm.lean`, is chosen to satisfy the following property: for every normed `𝕜`-vector space `F`, the linear equivalence `MultilinearMap 𝕜 E F ≃ₗ[𝕜] (⨂[𝕜] i, Eᵢ) →ₗ[𝕜] F` expressing the universal property of the tensor product induces an isometric linear equivalence `ContinuousMultilinearMap 𝕜 E F ≃ₗᵢ[𝕜] (⨂[𝕜] i, Eᵢ) →L[𝕜] F`.\r\n\r\nThe idea is the following: Every normed `𝕜`-vector space `F` defines a linear map from `⨂[𝕜] i, Eᵢ` to `ContinuousMultilinearMap 𝕜 E F →ₗ[𝕜] F`, which sends `x` to the map `f ↦ f.lift x`. Thanks to `PiTensorProduct.projectiveSeminorm_bound`, this map lands in `ContinuousMultilinearMap 𝕜 E F →L[𝕜] F`. As this last space has a natural operator seminorm, we get an induced seminorm on `⨂[𝕜] i, Eᵢ`, which, by `PiTensorProduct.projectiveSeminorm_bound`, is bounded above by the projective seminorm. We then take the `sup` of these seminorms as `F` varies; as this family of seminorms is bounded, its `sup` has good properties.\r\n\r\nIn fact, we cannot take the `sup` over all normed spaces `F` because of set-theoretical issues, so we only take spaces `F` in the same universe as `⨂[𝕜] i, Eᵢ`. We then prove in `PiTensorProduct.norm_eval_le_injectiveSeminorm` that this gives the same result, because every multilinear map from `E` to `F` factors though a normed vector space in the same universe as `⨂[𝕜] i, Eᵢ`.\r\n\r\n# Main definitions\r\n\r\n* `PiTensorProduct.projectiveSeminorm`: The projective seminorm on `⨂[𝕜] i, Eᵢ`.\r\n* `PiTensorProduct.toDualContinuousMultilinearMap`: The `𝕜`-linear map from `⨂[𝕜] i, Eᵢ` to `ContinuousMultilinearMap 𝕜 E F →L[𝕜] F` sending `x` to the map `f ↦ f x`.\r\n* `PiTensorProduct.injectiveSeminorm`: The injective seminorm on `⨂[𝕜] i, Eᵢ`.\r\n* `PiTensorProduct.liftEquiv`: The bijection between `ContinuousMultilinearMap 𝕜 E F`\r\nand `(⨂[𝕜] i, Eᵢ) →L[𝕜] F`, as a continuous linear equivalence.\r\n* `PiTensorProduct.liftIsometry`: The bijection between `ContinuousMultilinearMap 𝕜 E F`\r\nand `(⨂[𝕜] i, Eᵢ) →L[𝕜] F`, as an isometric linear equivalence.\r\n* `PiTensorProduct.tprodL`: The cacnonical continuous multilinear map from `E`\r\nto `⨂[𝕜] i, Eᵢ`.\r\n* `PiTensorProduct.mapL`: The continuous linear map from `⨂[𝕜] i, Eᵢ` to `⨂[𝕜] i, E'ᵢ`\r\ninduced by a family of continuous linear maps `Eᵢ →L[𝕜] E'ᵢ`.\r\n* `PiTensorProduct.mapLMultilinear`: The continuous multilinear map from\r\n`fun i ↦ (Eᵢ →L[𝕜] E'ᵢ)` to `(⨂[𝕜] i, Eᵢ) →L[𝕜] (⨂[𝕜] i, E'ᵢ)` sending a family\r\n`f` to `PiTensorProduct.mapL f`.\r\n\r\n# Main results\r\n\r\n* `PiTensorProduct.norm_eval_le_projectiveSeminorm`: For every `x` in `⨂[𝕜] i, Eᵢ` and every continuous multilinear map `f` from `E` to a normed space `F`, we have `‖f.lift  x‖ ≤ ‖f‖ * projectiveSeminorm x `. This implies in particular:\r\n* `PiTensorProduct.injectiveSeminorm_le_projectiveSeminorm`: The injective seminorm is bounded above by the projective seminorm.\r\n* `PiTensorProduct.norm_eval_le_injectiveSeminorm`: The main property of the injective seminorm on\r\n`⨂[𝕜] i, Eᵢ`: for every `x` in `⨂[𝕜] i, Eᵢ` and every continuous multilinear map `f` from `E`\r\nto a normed space `F`, we have `‖f.lift  x‖ ≤ ‖f‖ * injectiveSeminorm x `.\r\n* `PiTensorProduct.mapL_opNorm`: If `f` is a family of continuous linear maps\r\n`fᵢ : Eᵢ →L[𝕜] Fᵢ`, then `‖PiTensorProduct.mapL f‖ ≤ ∏ i, ‖fᵢ‖`.\r\n* `PiTensorProduct.mapLMultilinear_opNorm` : If `F` is a normed vecteor space, then\r\n`‖mapLMultilinear 𝕜 E F‖ ≤ 1`.\r\n\r\n# TODO (in a future PR)\r\n\r\nIf all `Eᵢ` are separated and satisfy `SeparatingDual`, then the seminorm on `⨂[𝕜] i, Eᵢ` is a norm. This uses the construction of a basis of the `PiTensorProduct`, hence depends on PR #11156. It should probably go in a separate file, which is why I am creating a directory Analysis/NormedSpace/PiTensorProduct.\r\n\r\n# Technical issues\r\n\r\n* Ideally, I would prefer not to define `liftEquiv` and to have only `liftIsometry`, but I am using `liftEquiv.left_inv` in the proof that `liftIsometry` preserves norms.\r\n\r\n---\r\n<!-- The text above the `---` will become the commit message when your\r\nPR is merged.

I explain the reason in the commit message and why I am not sure what to do:\r\nThe linter complains that the `@[simps!]` on line 265 (before the definition of `liftIsometry`) creates lemmas that can be proved by `simp`. However, if I remove this `@[simps!]`, then `simp` becomes unable to prove some of the later lemmas.\r\n\r\nI don't know what the \"correct\" solution is. Should I remove the `@[simps!]` and write out all the lemmas it generates (except the ones that the linter dislikes) explicitly ? This seems a bit stupid, and also I don't have a list of the lemmas that `@[simps!]` creates.",

This is\r\n    not necessarily true, but we will show that there exists a normed vector space `G` in\r\n    `Type (max (max uι u𝕜) uE)` and an injective isometry from `G` to `F` such that `f` factors\r\n    through a continuous multilinear map `f'` from `E = Π i, E i` to `G`, to which we can apply\r\n    the definition of `injectiveSeminorm`. The desired inequality for `f` then follows\r\n    immediately.\r\n    The idea is very simple: the multilinear map `f` corresponds by `PiTensorProduct.lift`\r\n    to a linear map from `⨂[𝕜] i, E i` to `F`, say `l`. We want to take `G` to be the image of\r\n    `l`, with the norm induced from that of `F`; to make sure that we are in the correct universe,\r\n    it is actually more convenient to take `G` equal to the coimage of `l` (i.e. the quotient\r\n    of `⨂[𝕜] i, E i` by the kernel of `l`), which is canonically isomorphic to its image by\r\n    `LinearMap.quotKerEquivRange`. -/\r\n```\r\nMultiline comments are nice!",

I explain the reason in the commit message and why I am not sure what to do:\r\nThe linter complains that the `@[simps!]` on line 265 (before the definition of `liftIsometry`) creates lemmas that can be proved by `simp`. However, if I remove this `@[simps!]`, then `simp` becomes unable to prove some of the later lemmas.\r\n\r\nI don't know what the \"correct\" solution is. Should I remove the `@[simps!]` and write out all the lemmas it generates (except the ones that the linter dislikes) explicitly ? This seems a bit stupid, and also I don't have a list of the lemmas that `@[simps!]` creates.",

              "body": "> Note that the autogenerated simp lemmas are not always very good, especially in complicated situations like this one. On the definition of `liftIsometry`, if you replace `@[simps!]` with `@[simps!?]`, you will see what lemmas are generated. For instance, the first simp lemma it registers is `((PiTensorProduct.liftIsometry 𝕜 E F) f) a = (PiTensorProduct.liftAux f.toMultilinearMap) a`, which is not so nice. In this case, it may be worth it removing the `@[simps]` alltogether and registering by hand more useful versions of the lemmas...\r\n\r\nYeah, I guess I will have to do that, as removing the `@[simps]` on `liftEquiv` did not help. Aw man. :-(",
