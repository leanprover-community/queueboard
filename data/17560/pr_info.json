But maybe this just suggests that we shouldn't be scared of importing more algebra since it is still basic algebra.\r\n\r\nBut I think this change is good in itself, and we can do better by stating it for `Module.Projective` (the file about projective modules is at distance 1 from `Mathlib.LinearAlgebra.FreeModule.Basic`, all other imports are useless, so that doesn't sound like import creep) : it is just a special case of [Module.projective_lifting_property](https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/Mathlib/Algebra/Module/Projective.html#Module.projective_lifting_property).\r\n\r\n~~At some point we should be able to do the same for [LinearMap.exists_leftInverse_of_injective](https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/Mathlib/LinearAlgebra/Basis/VectorSpace.html#LinearMap.exists_leftInverse_of_injective) (in injective modules), but we don't seem to have the `Free -> Injective` instance so it's not useful for now.~~ This is nonsense.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure my explanations are clear, feel free to tell me if not :sweat_smile: ",

But [LinearMap.exists_leftInverse_of_injective](https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/Mathlib/LinearAlgebra/Basis/VectorSpace.html#LinearMap.exists_leftInverse_of_injective) should still generalize to the case where `V` is an injective module, right? So really the main thing is that it doesn't hold for free modules because they are not necessarily injective? Or am I saying nonsense again?",
