One concern voiced there was that having an unbundled predicate in addition to the bundled `Homeomorph` structure would encourage a lot of API duplication. The way I've tried to avoid that is by only implementing API relating this to other unbundled properties of maps, such as with `IsHomeomorph.isClosedMap` - theorems involving properties of sets and spaces, like [Homeomorph.compactSpace](https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/Mathlib/Topology/Homeomorph.html#Homeomorph.compactSpace), are still available only for bundled homeomorphisms. My hope is that this provides enough API for most situations in which the `IsHomeomorph` predicate might be used, while also making it easy enough to convert between the `IsHomeomorph` and `Homeomorph` types when the additional API of `Homeomorph` is needed.",

That `Homeomorph` exists and that it should get preferred whenever the inverse is easy to write down.\n2. That we have this in part because we have much of the topological end of the library unbundled.\n3. Unlike many other `EquivLike` morphisms, `IsHomeomorph` is not just a `FunLike` version of the morphism + `Function.Bijective`, so something is actually gained by having this as a separate predicate.\n4. This predicate is useful when you *don't* have an easily written inverse, but you still want to access properties of homeomorphosms or potentially build one.\n\nPoints 2 and 3 also explain why we don't have this pattern for various equivs across the library.\n",

One concern voiced there was that having an unbundled predicate in addition to the bundled `Homeomorph` structure would encourage a lot of API duplication. The way I've tried to avoid that is by only implementing API relating this to other unbundled properties of maps, such as with `IsHomeomorph.isClosedMap` - theorems involving properties of sets and spaces, like [Homeomorph.compactSpace](https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/Mathlib/Topology/Homeomorph.html#Homeomorph.compactSpace), are still available only for bundled homeomorphisms. My hope is that this provides enough API for most situations in which the `IsHomeomorph` predicate might be used, while also making it easy enough to convert between the `IsHomeomorph` and `Homeomorph` types when the additional API of `Homeomorph` is needed.",
