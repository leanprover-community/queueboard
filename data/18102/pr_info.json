This is *not* the most general thing that could give you `StarOrderedRing C(α, R)` (as that would be an additional data `pieces : ℕ` and a function `sqrt : R × R → Fin pieces → R` which, given `x : R × R` with `x.1 ≤ x.2`, would satisfy `x.2 = x.1 + ∑ n : Fin pieces, sqrt x n * sqrt x n`). But I don't think the more general thing is worth it, because I don't even know when it might hold (except maybe for `α` discrete and `R := ℕ` because of `Nat.sum_four_squares`).",

              "body": "I think the answer is: it's both. I suspect that the proof you gave in #18209, while nice, obscures what's going on on \"under the hood\". If I have `(a, b)` and I express each of `a` and `b` as finite sums of `star s * s`, and there are different numbers in the terms, then the reason you can pad whichever one has fewer with `star 0 * 0` and then you're done. Likewise, this works for finite pi types, but *not* infinite ones due to the fact that you might decompose into arbitrarily many terms of the form `star s * s` as you go along the indices.\r\n\r\nSo, you might wonder if, supposing that every `r : R` decomposes into a finite sum of *at most* `n` terms of the form `star s * s` (with `n` independent of `r`), can you succeed for `C(α, R)`? The issue here is that you need `n` *functions* `f` so that the sum of `star f * f` is your finite element. The problem is that for each `x : α`, `f x` may decompose into a different number, and now the padding-by-zero trick doesn't work because you lose continuity (or maybe a better way to say it is that you have no good way to even *state* that this decomposition is continuous across `α`).\r\n\r\nDoes this make sense?\r\n\r\n(note: presumably it might be possible, although I'm not sure how, to cook up some example where you take two `StarOrderedRing`s `R₁` and `R₂`, where everything in `R₁` looks like `star s * s` and everything in `R₂` is the sum of two of these. Then you could maybe glue them together at zero. Then any continuous function with values in this space with domain `α`, it would have to cross `0` to get from `R₁` to `R₂`, and then you could successfully switch pad with zero on the preimage of `R₁` and the result would be continuous.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure the above description is actually possible given that these things need to be *rings*, and I don't even have an example of a `StarOrderedRing` like `R₂` right now, which is not itself an `R₁`.)\r\n\r\n ",

This is *not* the most general thing that could give you `StarOrderedRing C(α, R)` (as that would be an additional data `pieces : ℕ` and a function `sqrt : R × R → Fin pieces → R` which, given `x : R × R` with `x.1 ≤ x.2`, would satisfy `x.2 = x.1 + ∑ n : Fin pieces, sqrt x n * sqrt x n`). But I don't think the more general thing is worth it, because I don't even know when it might hold (except maybe for `α` discrete and `R := ℕ` because of `Nat.sum_four_squares`).",

              "body": "I think the answer is: it's both. I suspect that the proof you gave in #18209, while nice, obscures what's going on on \"under the hood\". If I have `(a, b)` and I express each of `a` and `b` as finite sums of `star s * s`, and there are different numbers in the terms, then the reason you can pad whichever one has fewer with `star 0 * 0` and then you're done. Likewise, this works for finite pi types, but *not* infinite ones due to the fact that you might decompose into arbitrarily many terms of the form `star s * s` as you go along the indices.\r\n\r\nSo, you might wonder if, supposing that every `r : R` decomposes into a finite sum of *at most* `n` terms of the form `star s * s` (with `n` independent of `r`), can you succeed for `C(α, R)`? The issue here is that you need `n` *functions* `f` so that the sum of `star f * f` is your finite element. The problem is that for each `x : α`, `f x` may decompose into a different number, and now the padding-by-zero trick doesn't work because you lose continuity (or maybe a better way to say it is that you have no good way to even *state* that this decomposition is continuous across `α`).\r\n\r\nDoes this make sense?\r\n\r\n(note: presumably it might be possible, although I'm not sure how, to cook up some example where you take two `StarOrderedRing`s `R₁` and `R₂`, where everything in `R₁` looks like `star s * s` and everything in `R₂` is the sum of two of these. Then you could maybe glue them together at zero. Then any continuous function with values in this space with domain `α`, it would have to cross `0` to get from `R₁` to `R₂`, and then you could successfully switch pad with zero on the preimage of `R₁` and the result would be continuous.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure the above description is actually possible given that these things need to be *rings*, and I don't even have an example of a `StarOrderedRing` like `R₂` right now, which is not itself an `R₁`.)\r\n\r\n ",
