Several results that were previously proved using induction have now been refactored to use this approach.\r\n> \r\n> The added results are all useful, so my opinion is that we should merge these changes. My only concern lies with the `@[deprecated (since := \"0204-08-09\")]` attributes, which I wish we could get rid of on the occasion of the current refactoring.\r\n\r\nThe new material is useful generally, but specifically is required to prove that a field is semireal if and only if it can be ordered -- PR on the way ;)\r\n\r\nAnd yeah not too sure about the alternative induction principle -- the motivation for it is that `IsSquare x` is easier to work with than `x * x` in practice, but I haven't actually found an application where it matters.",

Several results that were previously proved using induction have now been refactored to use this approach. \r\n\r\nThe added results are all useful, so my opinion is that we should merge these changes. My only concern lies with the `@[deprecated (since := \"0204-08-09\")]` attributes, which I wish we could get rid of on the occasion of the current refactoring.",

In that case, the lemmas I really want, such as `IsSumSq.mul`, would have to be proved by induction. However, I'm confused as I thought you previously indicated that you prefer the explicit sum-rewriting proof of `IsSumSq.mul` to the inductive one.",
