It's possible to further split this into two PRs, one is solely for separable degree of polynomials, another one is the application of these to separable degree of fields. But IMHO this makes PRs too fragmented.",

I think it would make the inductive step to show multiplicativity of separable degree slightly easier.\r\n> \r\n> Because the type of `Cardinal.mk (E →ₐ[F] (AlgebraicClosure F))` is `Cardinal.{max u v}`, while the type of `Cardinal.mk (E →ₐ[F] (AlgebraicClosure E))` is `Cardinal.{v}`, which is the same as `Module.rank F E`. This allows us to write `sepDegree F E = Module.rank F E` without mentioning `Cardinal.lift`.\r\n\r\nOh but that was a historical remark, since now `sepDegree` gets a new definition.",
