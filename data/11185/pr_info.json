So I would not mark `continuous_parametric_primitive_of_continuous` and for generality I would reformulate `continuous_parametric_intervalIntegral_of_continuous ` as \r\n```\r\ntheorem continuous_parametric_intervalIntegral_of_continuous\r\n    (hF : Continuous fun p : X × ℝ ↦ F p.1 p.2) \r\n    {a b : X → ℝ} (ha : Continuous a) (hb : continuous b) :\r\n    Continuous fun x ↦ ∫ t in a x..b x, F x t ∂μ\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn the short term, making that proof working is not within the reach of `fun_prop` as it would require significant modification to the code which decomposes function into a composition of two functions. Unfortunately, it does not work as expected when it comes to higher order functions.\r\n\r\nThe best I can offer is this proof\r\n```\r\ntheorem continuous_parametric_intervalIntegral_of_continuous {a₀ : ℝ}\r\n    (hF : Continuous fun p : X × ℝ ↦ F p.1 p.2) {s : X → ℝ} (hs : Continuous s) :\r\n    Continuous fun x ↦ ∫ t in a₀..s x, F x t ∂μ :=\r\n  Continuous.comp (g:=(fun p : X × ℝ ↦ ∫ t in a₀..p.2, F p.1 t ∂μ)) (f:=fun x ↦ (x, s x))\r\n    (by fun_prop) (by fun_prop)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe way `fun_prop` works now it tries to prove the continuity by decomposing the function as\r\n```\r\n    (fun x ↦ ∫ t in a₀..s x, F x t ∂μ)\r\n    =\r\n    (fun (f,b) => intervalIntegral f a₀ b μ) ∘ (fun x => (fun t => F x t, s x))\r\n```\r\nwhich is not useful.",

For example, `Finset.sum`\r\n```\r\nopen BigOperators \r\n@[fun_prop]\r\ntheorem sum_continuous {ι} [Fintype ι] :\r\n   Continuous fun (f : ι → ℝ) => ∑ i, f i := ...\r\n\r\n@[fun_prop]\r\ntheorem sum_continuous' {ι} [Fintype ι] (f : X → ι → ℝ) (hf : Continuous f) :\r\n   Continuous fun x => ∑ i, f x i := by fun_prop\r\n```\r\n`fun_prop` can already prove `sum_continuous'` from `sum_continuous`.\r\n\r\nTherefore the linter can't simple check if you are working with higher order function or not.",

It's easy to go back using `nhdsWithin_mono` if anyone does specifically need the statement for `𝓝[>]`.",

But I think `nhdsWithin_ge` is not yet in use in the library, so I suggest renaming these lemmas to one of the two existing names, to avoid adding a third synonym.)\r\n- Might it be simpler to inline the proof of `tendsto_measure_Icc_nhdsWithin_gt` inside `tendsto_measure_Icc_nhdsWithin_ge` rather than having it as a separate lemma? It's easy to go back using `nhdsWithin_mono` if anyone does specifically need the statement for `𝓝[>]`.",
