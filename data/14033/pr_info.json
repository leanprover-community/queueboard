So I would say that the best way to proceed is to make sure you applied the whole suggestion before resolving, and if you had a good reason not too, then indicate why and keep it unresolved so I can see it easily.\r\nOf course there are many comments and it is easy to oversee some, especially when there are many changes in one suggestion.\r\nIf a code suggestion seems reasonable to you, you can use the \"Commit suggestion\" button to automatically commit the change to the branch (make sure to refresh your local branch if you do that).
