        "body": "We currently implemented `succAbove` and `predAbove` in a way that encourages users to reduce things down to fiddling linear arithmetic, which makes it difficult to prove complicated identities.\r\n\r\n---\r\nIt is possible to re-define these and improve the proofs dramatically. An aid to this is to add \"predAboveOfNe\", which broadly is similar to `predAbove` but is a true inverse to `succAbove` in the appropriate manner. One can then prove results about this which let the simplifier make short work of identities that would otherwise be fairly complicated.\r\n\r\nThis also has the advantage of making insertNth easier to use.

              "body": "It's easier to see the difference if you just review the total change of all the patches. But yeah I think the main changes in Data/Fin/Basic.lean kinda need a line by line review. I am especially worried I've stated lemmas in inappropriate generality somewhere, or failed to \"mirror\" some theorems between predAbove and succAbove (as a rule of thumb, every result one should correspond to one in the other, more or less - there's a fundamental symmetry here).\r\n\r\nNote that the impact on other files is in some cases because the proofs are effectively in Basic.lean now! But also I've generally improved them, and part of the issue was in fact that things like the simplicial proofs really ought not to be only in the language of simplicial categories elsewhere, because they do genuinely occur in practice.",

I am especially worried I've stated lemmas in inappropriate generality somewhere, or failed to \"mirror\" some theorems between predAbove and succAbove (as a rule of thumb, every result one should correspond to one in the other, more or less - there's a fundamental symmetry here).\r\n\r\nNote that the impact on other files is in some cases because the proofs are effectively in Basic.lean now! But also I've generally improved them, and part of the issue was in fact that things like the simplicial proofs really ought not to be only in the language of simplicial categories elsewhere, because they do genuinely occur in practice.",
