        "body": "The lemma `normalize_apply` feels to me like it exposes the implementation detail that `normalize` is defined in terms of `normUnit`. I think the `normalize` function itself is much more familiar so it doesn't really seem like a simplification to insert `normUnit` instead. Indeed there are quite a few `simp [-normalize_apply]` in Mathlib.\r\n\r\nMoreover, there were some `simp` lemmas about `normalize` that had to be given higher priority since e.g. `normalize (a * b) = normalize a * normalize b` but `normUnit (a * b)` does not necessarily equal `normUnit a * normUnit b`.\r\n\r\nA few downstream fixes are needed where a `@[simp]` lemma is proved for `normUnit` and not for `normalize`, otherwise everything goes very smoothly.\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n<!-- The text above the `---` will become the commit message when your\r\nPR is merged.
