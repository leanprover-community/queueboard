It is related to the proof that presheaf categories are monoidal closed (abstract proof #16067 by @dagurtomas and a more explicit approach is #19103). With some little extra work, this internal hom will be used in order to show that the class `W` of morphisms of presheaves which induce iso on the associated sheaves satisfy the assumption in this PR #12728, which will give the expected monoidal category structure on categories of sheaves (with values in a symmetric (braided?) monoidal closed category that has suitable limits).

It is related to the proof that presheaf categories are monoidal closed (abstract proof #16067 by @dagurtomas and a more explicit approach is #19103). With some little extra work, this internal hom will be used in order to show that the class `W` of morphisms of presheaves which induce iso on the associated sheaves satisfy the assumption in this PR #12728, which will give the expected monoidal category structure on categories of sheaves (with values in a symmetric (braided?) monoidal closed category that has suitable limits).
