CPU cycles are cheap, after all; and there is the very good point raised in the Zulip discussion \"To automate or not not automate?\", that making explicit workarounds for slow tactics makes it less likely that tactic-development people will notice and work on the slowness. \r\n\r\nHence I've put in your `generalize` changes, but with a comment pointing out that it would be nice if `ring_nf` could do these things automatically. Are you happy with that compromise?\r\n\r\nRegards, David",

CPU cycles are cheap, after all; and there is the very good point raised in the Zulip discussion \"To automate or not not automate?\", that making explicit workarounds for slow tactics makes it less likely that tactic-development people will notice and work on the slowness. \r\n\r\nHence I've put in your `generalize` changes, but with a comment pointing out that it would be nice if `ring_nf` could do these things automatically. Are you happy with that compromise?\r\n\r\nRegards, David",
