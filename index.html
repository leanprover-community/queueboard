  <div class="btn-group">
    <a href="review_dashboard.html"><button>Review queue</button></a>
    <a href="maintainers_quick.html"><button>For maintainers (quick)</button></a>
    <a href="help_out.html"><button>Help out</button></a>
    <a href="triage.html"><button>Triage dashboard</button></a>

  <div class="btn-group"><a href="on_the_queue.html"><button>Why is my PR not on the queue? Can I see all my PRs?</button></a></div><p></p>
  <div class="btn-group"><a href="triage.html#all"><button>What's going on? Just show me all open PRs, please!</button></a></div><p></p>
  
  <details>
    <summary>What do these buttons mean? Which page should I visit?</summary>
    <ul>
      <li>If you just want to see all open PRs, there is a <a href="triage.html#all">dashboard</a> just for you.</li>
      <li>Would you like to review some pull request? The <strong><a href="review_dashboard.html">review dashboard</a></strong> contains all PRs waiting for review. There are special sections for PRs by new contributors, labelled <em>easy</em> or addressing technical debt.</li>
      <li>Would you like to find out <strong>why</strong> your PR is (not) <strong>on the review queue</strong>? Are you interested in an overview of all your PRs with their status? <a href="on_the_queue.html">This webpage</a> contains all information necessary.</li>
      <li>There is a webpage for <strong>maintainers with little time</strong>: this contains e.g. all PRs which are just awaiting maintainer approval.
      If you actually have some more time at your hands, the <a href="review_dashboard.html">page for reviewers</a> or the <a href="triage.html">triage dashboard</a> should be useful.</li>
      <li>Would you just like to <strong>help out</strong>? <a href="help_out.html">This page</a> collects PRs where help was requested, or where some quick action can be useful.</li>
      <li>Are you coming here for <strong>PR triage</strong>: looking for PRs stuck in some state, and would like to move them along? The <a href="triage.html">triage dashboard</a> has the ultimate collection of all public information.</li>
      <!-- 'hidden' page for maintainers to assign reviewers must be generated locally, by running a script -->
    </ul>
  </details>
  <p>Feedback (including bug reports and ideas for improvements) on this dashboard is very welcome, for instance <a href="https://github.com/jcommelin/queueboard">directly on the github repository</a>.</p>

  <h2 id="tips-and-tricks"><a href="#tips-and-tricks">Tips and tricks</a></h2>
  <details><summary>These webpages have a couple of hidden features. Click here to learn more.</summary>
  <div><ul>
  <li><strong>semantic sorting</strong>: clicking on a table column sorts by the column. This sorting is semantically correct: PR diffs are sorted by the total number of added or deleted lines, sorting by total time in review converts between months, days, hours and seconds</li>
  <li><strong>hovers</strong>: many items contain further information when you hover over it.
  Hover over a section header to see which PRs are contained in it, hover over a column definition to see what it measures, hover over a PR number to see its git branch name, hover over a time column to see the detailed time, etc.</li>
  <li><strong>author search</strong>: search for <code>author:name</code> to find all PRs by a particular author</li>
  <li><strong>assignee search</strong>: search for <code>assignee:name</code> to find all PRs assigned to this user</li>
  <li><strong>exact label matching</strong>: a few label names are prefixes of other labels, e.g. <code>t-algebra</code> is a prefix of <code>t-algebraic geometry</code>, so searching for <code>t-algebra</code> will also find <code>t-algebraic geometry</code> PRs.
  There is special support for this combining: searching for <code>t-algebra$</code> will match only PRs with label <code>t-algebra</code>.</li>
  <li><strong>find PRs by modified file</strong>: search for a file name and find all PRs in a list which modify this file. Searching for several files finds all PRs which modify all these files. (Caveat: we only track the first 100 files each PR changes, so this may yield incomplete results for cross-cutting PRs. Such PRs are rare, however.)</li>
  <li><strong>find your PRs</strong>: searching for your user name returns all PRs you reviewed or commented on</li>
  <li><strong>search PR description</strong>: searching also searches a PR description, and the list of all users who ever commented on this PR. To find all PRs from the sphere-eversion project, searching for "sphere eversion" (or "sphere eversion") should do the trick.</li>
  <li><strong>configuration via URL</strong>: you can configure the initial sorting, search terms and number of entries per page by changing the URL you're visiting. Three short examples:
    <ul>
      <li><a href="review_dashboard.html?sort=totalTimeReview-desc#queue"><code>review_dashboard.html?sort=totalTimeReview-desc#queue</code></a> sorts the #queue table by total time in review (in descending order),</li>
      <li><a href="triage.html=?search=manifold&sort=author-asc&length=10#all"><code>triage.html=?search=manifold&sort=author-asc&length=10#all</code></a> shows all PRs which contain the string "manifold" in their entry or PR description, sorted by author (in ascending order), with 10 items per page, and</li>
      <li><a href="on_the_queue.html?search=jcommelin&length=100"><code>on_the_queue.html?search=jcommelin&length=100</code></a> shows the status of all PRs by <code>jcommelin</code></li>
    </ul>
  <details><summary>Reference-level explanation of search syntax</summary>
  The <code>search</code> parameter filters all tables on a page by default.
  The <code>sort</code> parameter changes the initial sorting of all dashboards; if the parameter is given several times, this configures a multi-column sort (sorting by the first parameter first). A valid value is of the form <code>idxOrAlias-direction</code>, where <code>direction</code> is either <code>asc</code> or <code>desc</code> (for ascending or descending order), and <code>idxOrAlias</code> describes the column to sort.
  All columns have human-readable names: these are <code>number</code>, <code>author</code>, <code>title</code>, <code>labels</code>, <code>diff</code>, <code>numberChangedFiles</code>, <code>numberComments</code>, <code>assignee</code>, <code>approvals</code>, <code>lastUpdate</code>, <code>lastStatusChange</code> and <code>totalTimeReview</code>, respectively &emdash; mapping to the obvious column.
  Alternatively (deprecated), you can pass in the (0-based) index of the column you want to sort. (You have to account for hidden columns, and there are no stability guarantees. This option is only kept for backwards compatibility.)
  </details>
  </li>
  <li><strong>filtering</strong>: click on a label or PR author to filter by this author</li>
  <li><strong>exact match when searching</strong>: searching for <code>foo bar</code> will match all PRs whose entry contains the string foo and the string bar (but at potentially different places). Searching for <code>"foo bar"</code> only yields literal occurrences of the string <code>foo bar</code></li>
  <li><strong>multi-column sorting</strong>: use shift-click to sort by a second (or third, etc.) column</li>
  </ul></div>
